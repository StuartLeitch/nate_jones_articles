*How do you actually build a side-gig?*

*I know everyone says that’s the key to success in the age of AI. It’s supposed to be good for your career if you’re a junior, good for side-income as a senior in your career.*

*It’s supposed to be an unprecedented age for entrepreneurs.*

*But where do you go to get started? You’re supposed to partner with AI for this stuff—but what does that actually mean day-to-day? What prompts do you use? What tools? Who’s done it before?*

*This guide answers all that, and more. It’s the result of hundreds of conversations with builders over the last year. It’s a complete kit to help you take advantage of the biggest building opportunity I’ve seen in my lifetime.*

*This guide is not theory. It’s not hype. It’s your exact, step-by-step playbook for 2025:*

- *A **strategy framework** showing why right now is the shortest, most explosive opportunity ever to launch a micro-niche side gig with AI.*
- ***15 copy-and-paste AI prompts** that run market scans, validate ideas, generate prototypes, and even prepare you for user interviews or investor debates.*
- *The **5-tool stack** (Lovable.dev, Outseta, Vercel, Framer, Google Gemini API) that turns weekends into working demos—no boilerplate, no team, no excuses.*
- *A **live case study** showing a builder hitting $9K MRR in months, complete with launch channels, growth tactics, and the mistake they fixed to cut refunds in half.*
- *A **no-BS FAQ** that answers the seven biggest hang-ups—no coding? distribution? feature creep? AI overwhelm?—with my honest answers as a founder.*
- ***Five extra build guides** from solo founders who actually made real MRR, covering everything from pricing spreadsheets to solo-founder survival tactics.*

*You’re wondering what it takes to get started. You’re wondering if you can do it. You can! I’ve seen it happen over and over again. Let’s rocket your side gig into orbit.

PS. Tell me what you’re building in the comments!*


# Why side gigs, why now?

AI is everywhere now, and you don’t need a giant team or fancy lab to make it work. Big companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic let you plug into their AI engines with a few clicks.

That means you can spend a couple of weekends coding up a little tool that solves someone’s real problem: like helping small online shops read customer reviews or giving writers quick topic ideas. And then if it clicks you can start making money fast. You don’t have to wait months to build a team or raise cash. You just find a tiny niche, ship something that works, and let people pay you for it before the big guys even notice. And if they don’t? Well bet again! Bets are cheap.

There are so many tiny markets out there—like Etsy sellers, local food bloggers, or student project teams—that big tech never bothers to fix. They build one-size-fits-all tools, but you can build exactly what those micro-groups need.

If you can show just a few people your tool solves their problem, you can get them to pay you. Then you keep improving based on their feedback. It’s a perfect time to hack together a side project after school or on weekends, turn it into real cash, and learn tons along the way.


# What about distribution?

Distribution is a fancy word for getting your product into people’s hands. And that’s increasingly THE key challenge in the age of AI.

Even the coolest app won’t matter if nobody knows it exists, so you need to nail your distribution plan before you write a single line of code.

Everyone’s building AI tools, and there’s no shortage of options, which means you can’t rely on “build it and they will come.” Instead, figure out where your future users already hang out. Think a Discord server for indie game devs or a Reddit community for school project groups. Then plan your launch around those spaces.

Think about how you’ll grab customer attention with something helpful, funny, or unique right from day one, whether that’s a free mini-demo, a quick how-to video, or an insider tip that solves their pain point immediately.

Once you’ve mapped out your distribution channels, you can tweak your product to fit those audiences perfectly, making it easier for your early fans to become your biggest promoters.

Use referral links, community shout-outs, or partnerships with small creators who already talk to your crowd. This turns your first users into your marketing team. By prioritizing distribution ahead of product polish, you’ll avoid spending weeks building features nobody sees and instead focus on creating something that real people will actually use and share.

One more note here: it really helps to already be a member of the communities you want to reach. People can smell fake a mile away.


# **Which AI Model Should I Choose?**

Don't overthink this. Seriously. Most people get stuck comparing GPT-5 vs Claude Opus 4.1 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro when they should be building their side-gig instead. The truth is, for most micro-niche projects, any decent AI model will work fine. If you already have ChatGPT Plus, use that. If you're budget-conscious, Google Gemini has a generous free tier. If you prefer Claude's writing style, go with Claude. The differences between top models are way smaller than the difference between using AI and not using it at all. (And the good prompts below will help even out those differences.)

Here's what actually matters: don't let AI become your only source of information or decision-making. AI is amazing at scaffolding code, generating first drafts, and brainstorming ideas, but it can't replace your brain or your real-world knowledge of your micro-niche.

You still need to talk to actual users, test your assumptions, and make judgment calls about what features to build and cut. Think of AI as a super-powered intern who's great at the grunt work but needs your direction and oversight.

The biggest mistake new builders make is asking AI to decide everything—which niche to target, what features to add, how to price their product. AI doesn't know your market like you do.

It can't feel the frustration of your potential users or spot the subtle workflow problems that your community complains about in Discord. Use AI to speed up the building and writing, but keep your eyes and ears open to the real world. That's where the money is.

# Case Study: Lean’s [Sync2Sheets](https://sync2sheets.com/)


### From Freelancer to $9K MRR Solopreneur in 2025

In the fast-paced world of solopreneurship, few stories capture the essence of rapid execution and niche problem-solving like that of [Lean](https://x.com/LeanZubrezki), a former freelance software developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. As detailed in Starter Story's 2025 profitability report on solopreneurs (updated April 17, 2025), Lean pivoted from inconsistent freelancing gigs to building and launching Sync2Sheets—a lightweight SaaS tool that automatically syncs Notion databases with Google Sheets. What started as a personal frustration with manual data transfers exploded into a sustainable business generating **$9,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR)** within months of launch, all while operating solo with minimal overhead.


#### Background

Lean Zubrezki, a software developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina, transitioned from freelance development to building Sync2Sheets, a SaaS tool. Previously earning $3,000–$5,000/month freelancing, he sought stable income after experiencing burnout from inconsistent client work.


#### Product

Sync2Sheets is a Google Workspace Add-On that enables real-time bidirectional syncing between Notion databases and Google Sheets. It targets solopreneurs, small agencies, and teams needing automated data transfers. The tool is listed on the Google Workspace Marketplace with over 70,000 installs and is integrated with Notion’s ecosystem.


#### Development and Launch

- **Tech Stack**: Built using no-code/low-code tools, including Bubble.io and Zapier for core syncing functionality.

# **FAQ: Your Top Questions Answered**

1. **Do I need coding skills?**
   No. You really can do this without code. And that’s becoming more possible every single month. What you DO need is the old-fashioned stubbornness coupled with those new AI skills I talk about above (like spotting distribution advantage).
2. **How do I find my first users?**
   Seriously, start inside groups you’re already in—Discord, Reddit, or school clubs. Share a free demo or helpful tip and invite friends to try it. This is also a product hint—start where you know the problem well.
3. **My model is giving bad results!**
   Well first, load it with some more context about you and your goals! And second, switch models if it still sucks. Models are cheap. Your ability to execute quickly is what matters.
4. **When should I stop adding features?**
   I think it was Chanel that said look in the mirror and take one thing off. Well, same goes for product. You should be stopping with features BEFORE you think you need to, because most people over-build.
5. **What’s the most important metric?**
   Your time-to-value. How much time do you spend on a bet before you can get feedback from real customers? If that’s a smaller number, you’re gonna get more bets, which is gonna increase your odds of a blowout success.
6. **How do I pick a price?**
   Ask a friend to be honest with you and get them to give you an arms-length price read. If they squint. Or roll their eyes. Or look at all hesitant—your value is too low or the price is too high.
7. **What if a big company copies me?**
   So what. Keep building. Keep distributing. Take it as a compliment!

# **First Steps Checklist**

Ready to start? Here’s how I’d get going…

Day 0: Nail Your Job Story & Plan

- Write a 1–2 sentence job story: “When I’m [situation], I want to [action], so I can [value].”
- List the 3–5 steps of your “happy path.”
- Set your cut-line: the only features you must ship in Week 1.
- Choose your core metric (e.g., time-to-first-win ≤ 2 minutes).

Day 1: Scaffold Your Prototype

- Paste your first prompt into Lovable.dev: “Build a React/Tailwind app for [job story], with inputs/outputs and fake data.”
- Confirm you have a clickable demo link by the end of the day.

Day 2: Add AI Integration

- Use your AI model prompt: “Integrate Google Gemini API to process user inputs and display results.”
- Test with sample data and ensure the AI response shows in your demo.

Day 3: Spine Pass

- Add input validation and clear error messages.
- Instrument five telemetry events (e.g., “app\_started,” “action\_completed”).
- Set p95 latency and cost budgets, and fail closed with friendly copy.

Day 4: User Testing

- Invite 3 people from your niche to try the demo.
- Record their time-to-first-win and note any friction points.

Day 5: Feedback & Fixes

- Review your notes and fix the top three friction points.
- Confirm your demo still works end-to-end and improves user speed.

Day 6: Distribution Prep

- Draft one outreach message for each channel (Discord, Reddit, newsletter).
- Create a referral link or shareable button in your app.

Day 7: Launch & Decision

- Post your demo link in your chosen communities with a helpful tip or mini-tutorial.
- Measure early sign-ups or clicks.
- Decide: **Keep** iterating and add one distribution loop, or **Kill** and start the next niche sprint.

# Wrapping it up

Entrepreneurship is personal to me. This guide is personal to me. I’ve been building businesses and products for a long time. I’ve coached hundreds of people on building products in the AI age.

I have never seen this much opportunity for builders, and at the same time I’ve never seen this much fear. Most people I talk to are so worried. They’re worried about what Sam Altman will do. Or if they have the technical skills. Or whether their idea is good.

I got news for you: the only thing separating you from your dreams here is your worries. And you’re in charge of those. I can’t guarantee results, but I do know that building stuff has never been easier, this is a unique window that won’t last long, and you have the skills it takes to build.

And building increases your surface area for luck—so get building, and get lucky!
