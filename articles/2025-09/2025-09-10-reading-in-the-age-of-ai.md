*I'm the guy with books in every single video.*

*Look behind me in any frame—there they are, spine after spine, because reading is how I metabolize the world. So when people started flooding my inbox asking "What should I read about AI?" and "Is reading even worth it when ChatGPT can summarize everything?"—I couldn't just send them a list.*

*The more I listened, the more I realized I was hearing from completely different audiences. The C-suite executive trying to make AI strategy decisions doesn't need the same books as the engineer building models. The product manager working with AI teams needs different foundations than the policy maker writing regulations. Everyone was drowning in the same overwhelming flood of AI content, but they needed different lifelines.*

*There’s been a pandemic of various sources claiming we’re experiencing "knowledge rot"—that AI is destroying human knowledge by endlessly recycling and regurgitating information. The panic is palpable. People are either abandoning books entirely ("why read when AI can summarize?") or mindlessly parroting claims that you can read War and Peace in 10 minutes with AI (yes I saw someone claiming that on TikTok, she said she read 40 books a day and I wanted to scream.)*

*I think we’re approaching this completely wrong.*

*The problem isn't that AI is rotting knowledge. Making knowledge rot the object paralyzes us. It’s an incorrect frame.*

*The problem is we're using old mental models for a new information landscape. **This is a skill issue, and it’s absolutely solvable.** We don't have a knowledge crisis—we have a filtering crisis. And nobody's teaching us how to read strategically when we have an AI companion literally in our pocket.*

***What's in this guide:***

*• **34 carefully curated AI books** organized into five distinct learning pathways (Executive Strategist, Technical Practitioner, Informed Professional, Policy Maker, Startup Founder)*

*• **Three types of reading decoded**: Awareness reading (scanning), retrieval reading (hunting facts), and connectome reading (deep rewiring)—plus exactly when to use each*

*• **The Quick Guide**: Strategic shortcuts for identifying which 20% of any book deserves deep attention*

*• **The Complete Guide**: Comprehensive prompt library, workflows for different content types, and a 90-day implementation plan*

*• **Interactive Claude artifact**: Personalized pathway matcher that shows how to use AI to save 40-60% reading time while improving comprehension*

*• **My actual reading methods**: How I read "hungrily" between writing and videos, using AI as reconnaissance before diving deep*

*• **Time estimates and prerequisites** for every book, so you know exactly what you're committing to*

*• **The anti-knowledge-rot thesis**: Why we need better filters, not less AI*

*I've spent months building this because I believe we can read more effectively with AI, not despite it. Once you understand which type of reading you need for which book, and how to use AI as a reading companion rather than a replacement, everything changes. You read more, not less. You comprehend better, not worse. You save your deep reading energy for what actually matters.*

*This isn't about reading less, or reading less carefully. It's about matching your reading approach to what you're actually trying to achieve.*


#### *[The Quick Guide to Reading in the Age of AI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jTfUPAegrbSh3xKGEcGxgfckZQ2m05eg714_RJSgfFU/edit?usp=sharing)*

This guide is about being strategic with your brain. It shows you how to use AI to quickly identify which 20% of any book actually deserves your deep attention, how to extract what you need from the other 80% without pretending you read it all, and how to synthesize insights across books without burning out.

I'm not telling you to read less—I'm showing you how to match your reading approach to what you're trying to achieve. Sometimes you need every word. Sometimes you need the frameworks. Sometimes you just need to know an argument exists. The trick is knowing which is which, and using AI to handle the information processing so you can save your deep reading capacity for what actually matters.


#### *[The Complete Guide to Reading in the Age of AI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uaZ1tAR82iIBGYGCFXjY17YiE2fUbIxUeja9cpu-85o/edit?usp=sharing)*

This guide teaches you how to read strategically in the age of AI. It's built around a systematic approach where you allocate your attention based on what actually matters—deep focus for the 20% that's crucial, strategic skimming for the rest.

The guide includes a curated library of AI books (also listed below), organized by learning progression, with realistic time estimates and prerequisites for each. There's a comprehensive prompt library that helps you use AI tools to enhance comprehension rather than replace thinking—prompts for confusion resolution, argument analysis, and synthesizing across multiple books.

It also provides specific workflows for different types of content (technical books, business strategy, research papers) and a 90-day implementation plan to build these practices into your routine. The core insight is that you have finite cognitive resources and need to be strategic about where you invest them, especially given the overwhelming amount of AI content available.


# Reading in the Age of AI

I've been getting asked constantly about reading. People look at my (extremely internet visible) bookshelf and ask what I read, how I know I'm reading the right things, whether reading even matters anymore when AI can summarize everything. The Wall Street Journal came out this week with an assessment suggesting we're experiencing "knowledge rot" because AI is just recycling and regurgitating information. No new knowledge being produced, just summaries of summaries.

I don't think that's quite right. But I've been struggling to articulate why, and I think I finally understand what's happening.

The way we learned to read was shaped by scarcity. You wrote things down to remember them. Reading was retrieval. That was the fundamental technology—commerce records, court documents, sacred texts. The act of reading was inseparable from the act of remembering.

But I've been noticing something in my own reading habits. I read differently depending on what I'm trying to accomplish, and I don't think we have good language for these differences. Sometimes I'm scrolling through articles just to know what's out there. Sometimes I'm hunting for a specific fact or technique. And sometimes—rarely, but importantly—I'm reading in a way that restructures how I think.


## Three Kinds of Reading

Let me try to name what I've been observing. I think there are three fundamentally different activities we call "reading," and conflating them is part of why we're so confused about AI's impact on knowledge.

The first is what I think of as awareness reading. You're scrolling X, skimming headlines, flipping through books at the bookstore. You're not trying to remember everything—you're trying to maintain a sense of what's happening in your field. It's like monitoring radar. You need to know what's on the horizon without studying every blip in detail.

I used to feel guilty about this kind of reading, as if I was cheating by not going deeper. But I've come to think awareness reading serves a critical function. The problem is we don't have good filters for determining what deserves more attention.

The second type is information retrieval. This is what we do with Google, though we don't usually call it reading. You need a specific fact, a particular technique, an answer to a concrete question. When I look up how token architecture works or search for a Python library, I'm doing retrieval reading.

I think LLMs are essentially retrieval reading machines. What people are calling "Answer Engine Optimization" is just SEO for this kind of reading. And that's fine—retrieval reading has always been instrumental rather than transformative.

The third type is what I'm calling connectome reading, though I'm not entirely satisfied with the term. This is reading that literally rewires your brain—forming new neural pathways, pruning old ones, building new patterns of thought. It's metabolically expensive. Research suggests deep reading burns significant glucose because your brain is working so hard to integrate new structures.

Teachers worry this kind of reading is disappearing, and they might be right. But I wonder if part of the problem is that we expect people to do too much of it. You can't connectome-read everything. Your brain doesn't have the energy.


## Using AI as a Reading Tool

Once I started thinking about reading this way, my whole approach to using AI changed. Instead of feeling like AI was replacing reading, I began using it to be more intentional about which kind of reading I was doing.

Take a book like *AI Literacy Fundamentals* by Ben Jones. It's clearly designed for beginners, packed with facts about how AI systems work. This is perfect for retrieval reading with AI assistance. I get the physical book—I think having the actual text matters—but then I work with Claude or GPT-5 Pro as a reading guide. I describe what I already know and what I'm trying to learn, and the AI helps me navigate to exactly the sections I need. What would be a 10-hour cover-to-cover read becomes 2 hours of targeted learning.

But then there's something like Ethan Mollick's *Co-Intelligence*. That book builds an argument cumulatively. Each chapter assumes you've internalized the previous one. The value isn't in isolated facts but in how the ideas interconnect and build on each other. You need to read it end to end, let it sink in. No shortcuts.

The WSJ article about knowledge rot? Pure awareness reading. I need to know the argument exists, understand the thesis. Perplexity can extract that in thirty seconds. Spending twenty minutes reading the full article wouldn't add much value.


## How I Actually Read

I read hungrily, in whatever scraps of time I can steal between writing, making videos, and taking care of the kids. I'm like Danny Ocean in Ocean's 11—I'm looking to raid and read with stealth and style.

I don't mind summaries. I'll ask Perplexity to dive into a book or topic, but I use it as reconnaissance. Is there something here worth retrieving, or do I need to order this and actually dive deep? Since I've probably read more about AI than 99% of people at this point, it's less about filling gaps and more about tracking where the entire field is moving.

I use Notebook LM to help me process arXiv papers. I use GPT-5 Pro for others. I'm AI-omnivorous just like I'm reading-omnivorous. AI is my chisel to break into the reading, and then I grab and devour whatever I can, always looking to maximize those moments where I can spark connections between what I'm reading.

The thing is, I still do connectome reading on some AI texts when they promise to restructure how I think about the field. But I also love fiction for connectome reading—it stretches my brain in completely different ways. When you're swimming in technical content all day, a great novel rewires you in ways that no technical book can.


## Finding the Cracks Between Domains

Here's where things get interesting. I've been learning Swedish—not well, but learning. I have this unusual background: I speak English and Indonesian. There's literally nothing written about learning Swedish from an Indonesian baseline. No textbook addresses this specific combination.

So I worked with GPT-5 Pro to create something new: a framework for understanding Swedish grammar through Indonesian patterns. It's not revolutionary—any linguist who knows both languages could create it. But nobody has, because the market is too small to justify the effort.

This is what excites me about AI-assisted reading and learning. The advanced reasoning models are remarkably good at stitching between domains. If you have knowledge in multiple areas, AI can help you find the cracks between them, the unexpected connections that your particular background makes visible.

I don't know what your version of Swedish-Indonesian might be. Maybe you know both finance and ecology, or cooking and chemistry, or project management and theater. Whatever domains you've inhabited, there are probably bridges between them that nobody's built because the audience would be too small. But AI doesn't care about market size.


## The Real Problem Isn't Knowledge Rot

I think the knowledge rot thesis misunderstands what's happening. We're not producing less knowledge. If anything, we're drowning in information—good information, valuable expertise, important insights. The problem is our filters have collapsed.

It reminds me of what's happened in hiring. Recruiters aren't getting fewer resumes; they're getting thousands of AI-polished applications that all look perfect. The system didn't break from scarcity. It broke from abundance without adequate filtering mechanisms.

The same thing is happening with reading and knowledge. We need better ways to sort through the avalanche, to identify what deserves awareness reading versus retrieval reading versus deep engagement. And I think AI, properly used, can be part of that solution rather than the problem.


## What This Means for You

The hardest part isn't reading efficiently—it's choosing what deserves deep reading. We have limited glucose, limited time, limited deep attention. In a world of infinite content, the core skill becomes curation rather than consumption.

My heuristic: if a book might change how I think about a domain, it gets connectome reading. If it's teaching me specific facts or skills, it gets retrieval reading. Everything else gets awareness reading or gets skipped entirely.

This isn't about reading less. I'm reading more than ever—but I'm reading strategically. Awareness reading keeps me current without drowning. Retrieval reading gets me specific knowledge efficiently. And I save my deep reading energy for books that might actually change how I think—whether that's Richard Hamming on engineering or a novel that shows me a completely different way of seeing the world.


## The Question of Passion

What worries me isn't knowledge rot but something more fundamental. Your curiosity, your passion for a subject, your desire to understand—AI can't generate these. It can only amplify them.

When students use AI to generate essays without engaging with the material, the problem isn't the technology. It's that we haven't given them reasons to care. The educational system that measured understanding through essay production was always measuring compliance more than comprehension. AI just made the game obvious.

The people who create genuinely new knowledge have always been voracious readers who composted information until something new emerged. They read customers, markets, technical papers, philosophy—whatever fed their obsession. That magical compost pile where ideas decompose and recombine still requires human passion to generate heat.

I think about Richard Hamming's *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering*, a book from the Stripe Press collection that isn't directly about AI but explains how innovation happens in technical spaces. You can't summary-hack your way through it. You have to let it change how you think about creative technical work.


## Moving Forward

I don't have all the answers here. I'm still experimenting, still learning what works. But I'm convinced the problem isn't that AI is destroying reading or creating knowledge rot. The problem is we're using old mental models for a new information landscape.

Maybe we need to be more honest about the different types of reading and their different purposes. Maybe we need to recognize that deep reading is a limited resource that should be carefully allocated. Maybe we need to get better at using AI as a reading assistant rather than a reading replacement.

I keep coming back to passion and curiosity. If you care about something, really care about it, you'll find yourself naturally doing all three types of reading. You'll awareness-read to understand the landscape, retrieval-read to fill specific gaps, and connectome-read the works that promise to transform your understanding.

The tools are just tools. What matters is having something you want to understand badly enough to use them well.

## Your AI-Accelerated Learning Pathways

I've built an interactive tool that matches you to one of five learning pathways. Let me explain how I think about this, because it's different from just giving you a reading list.


### The Three Ways We Actually Read

I've been thinking about this a lot. We call everything "reading," but I've noticed I do three completely different things with books:

Sometimes I'm reading to fundamentally change how I think—what I call connectome reading. I need every word. I need to sit with ideas. AI can help clarify confusing parts, but I'm doing the hard work of letting the book rewire my brain.

Other times I'm just hunting for specific information—retrieval reading. I don't need to read all 800 pages of *Deep Learning* to understand CNNs. I need someone to point me to the right chapter and explain the math. That's where AI shines.

And then there's awareness reading—I just need to know what's out there. What are the main arguments? What frameworks exist? I'm scanning the field, not studying it deeply.

Once I started thinking this way, my whole approach to using AI with books changed.


### The Five Pathways I've Identified

**The Executive Strategist**

I designed this for leaders who need to make AI decisions but aren't going to code. You're dealing with boards asking about AI strategy, vendors pitching solutions, teams proposing initiatives.

The pathway starts with basic literacy—not to make you technical, but to decode the vocabulary. Then it moves through strategic frameworks. What surprised me is how important the cognitive science books are here. *Thinking, Fast and Slow* isn't an AI book, but understanding cognitive biases is essential for seeing how AI changes organizational decision-making.

You'll read *Co-Intelligence* deeply because Mollick has actually done this—he's deployed AI in organizations. But for something like *Competing in the Age of AI*, you're extracting frameworks, not reading every case study. Let AI pull out what applies to your industry.

**The Technical Practitioner**

This is for engineers who need to build real systems. I've watched too many developers try to read *Deep Learning* cover to cover and burn out. That's not how technical learning works.

These books become your reference library. You're building something, you hit a problem, you look up the solution. AI becomes your pair programmer—translating math to code, explaining error messages, suggesting alternatives.

The progression matters though. Start with *The Master Algorithm* to understand different ML paradigms—it organizes the chaos. Then *Hands-On Machine Learning* for practical foundations. Only then tackle the heavy math books, and only the parts you need.

**The Informed Professional**

This one's close to my heart because it's for people like product managers and designers who work with AI but won't write training loops. You need to know what's possible, what's dangerous, what's hype.

The balance here is tricky. You need enough technical understanding to push back on engineering ("this seems like it should be simple") but also know when to accept constraints. You need to write prompts that actually work. You need to spot vendor BS.

*Co-Intelligence* is helpful for getting a sense of where customers are at, and you should play close attention to it. *Prompt Engineering* is pure retrieval—find the patterns that work for your role. *Hello World* is awareness—know where algorithms fail without memorizing every example.

**The Policy Maker**

I'll be honest—this pathway asks more of you than the others. If you're writing regulations or studying societal impact, you need deep understanding of both capabilities and limitations.

You'll read books like *Gödel, Escher, Bach* that aren't even about AI directly, because understanding intelligence philosophically matters for governance. You need to know not just what AI does, but what we're even talking about when we say "intelligence."

The technical books here are for literacy, not implementation. You need to understand transformers well enough to know if proposed regulations would actually work, but you're not building them.

**The Startup Founder**

This is for entrepreneurs who see AI opportunity but need to separate reality from hype. You need to know enough to hire well, make architecture decisions, and not compete where you can't win.

Start with *The Scaling Era*—these are the people building the frontier models, talking candidly about what's real. You need to hear this directly, not filtered through press releases. Then build technical literacy—enough to evaluate your engineers' decisions, not enough to make them yourself.

The strategic books matter here too. *High Growth Handbook* has maybe three chapters directly relevant to AI companies, but those chapters are gold. Let AI extract them.


### How I Actually Use AI with Books

Before I start a book, I tell AI what I'm trying to accomplish. Not just "summarize this book" but "I'm a founder trying to understand if LLMs are right for my product. What should I focus on?" (And yes, I do sometimes read without AI entirely, and I think that’s a good practice too!)

For deep reading, I use AI like a reading companion. After each chapter: "Help me think about this. What questions should this raise? How does this connect to what I read last week?" I'm not asking for summaries—I'm asking for thought partnership.

For retrieval reading, I'm shameless about jumping around. "I need to understand RLHF for a board presentation. Where do I look and what's the simplest valid explanation?" I'm treating the book like documentation, not literature.

For awareness reading, I want frameworks and updates. "Extract the strategic frameworks and update the 2019 examples with current ones." I'm not pretending I read the whole thing—I'm getting what I need.

The thing is, this isn't about reading less. I read more than ever. But I read strategically, matching my approach to what I'm trying to achieve.

## Your Personalized AI Learning Pathway


#### *[Grab the link to the Claude artifact that illustrates these learning paths](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/67acf758-f836-4ccb-a17e-db7752c6d379)*

I've created an interactive tool that matches you with one of five specialized AI learning pathways based on your role and goals. Each pathway is carefully sequenced, tells you exactly which reading mode to use for each book (awareness, retrieval, or connectome), and shows you how AI assistance can save 40-60% of your reading time while improving comprehension.

The five pathways are:

**The Executive Strategist** - For C-suite executives and senior managers who need to make informed AI decisions without getting lost in technical details. Focus on strategy, ethics, and organizational transformation.

**The Technical Practitioner** - For engineers and developers transitioning into AI. Heavy on implementation, from basic ML through transformers to production systems.

**The Informed Professional** - For product managers, designers, marketers, and other professionals who work with AI but don't build it. Balances practical skills with critical thinking.

**The Policy Maker** - For government officials, regulators, academics, and journalists who need to understand AI's societal implications. Emphasizes philosophical foundations and systemic thinking.

**The Startup Founder** - For entrepreneurs building AI companies. Combines technical literacy with strategic thinking, scaling wisdom, and market reality.

Each pathway shows you exactly how to use AI to accelerate your learning—not through shortcuts, but through smart augmentation. You'll see time breakdowns for each book, specific AI strategies, and prompts you can use to maximize comprehension.

### Technical Implementation

If you're going to build AI systems, these are your reference manuals. I've organized them from accessible to advanced. Géron's *Hands-On Machine Learning* remains the best practical starting point I've found—actual code that works, explained clearly. The deeper books like Goodfellow's *Deep Learning* and Bishop's *Pattern Recognition* provide the mathematical foundations when you need them. A word of warning: don't try to read these cover to cover. Treat them as technical references and dive into specific chapters as your projects demand.

**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (3rd Edition)** — Aurélien Géron

### Large Language Models & Modern AI

The field moved so fast that we needed entirely new books about transformers and LLMs. These authors are practitioners who've built and deployed these systems. What I find valuable here is the emphasis on engineering rather than theory—Raschka shows you how to build an LLM from scratch, while Huyen explains how to keep it running in production. If you're working with AI tools professionally, Phoenix and Taylor's prompt engineering guide has become essential. These books acknowledge that most of us will use existing models rather than train new ones, and they focus on doing that well.

**Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)** — Sebastian Raschka

Draws from author's experience at major tech companies, providing battle-tested patterns and anti-patterns.


### AI Theory & Philosophy

Sometimes you need to step back and think about what we're actually building. These books tackle the bigger questions—what is intelligence, how do we align AI with human values, what are we even trying to achieve? Christian's *The Alignment Problem* manages to be both technically informed and philosophically rich. Domingos attempts to unify all of machine learning into one framework. Russell and Norvig provide the academic foundations that everything else builds on. I turn to these when I need to think deeply about AI rather than just implement it.

**The Master Algorithm** — Pedro Domingos

Explores the quest for a universal learning algorithm that could derive all knowledge from data. Examines five tribes of machine learning (symbolists, connectionists, evolutionaries, Bayesians, analogizers) and their approaches.

Essential reading for understanding why AI safety matters and current approaches to building beneficial AI systems.

**Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th Edition)** — Stuart Russell & Peter Norvig

Definitive textbook covering the full breadth of AI from search algorithms to deep learning. Comprehensive treatment of classical and modern AI techniques with rigorous foundations. Includes problem-solving, knowledge representation, planning, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning. Standard reference for university courses and practitioners seeking thorough understanding of AI principles and methods.


### Systems Thinking & Cognitive Science

AI doesn't exist in isolation—it interacts with human cognition, organizational systems, and social structures. These books help you understand those interactions. Kahneman's work on cognitive biases becomes essential when you realize AI systems can amplify or mitigate those same biases. Meadows teaches you to see feedback loops and emergent behaviors. Hofstadter's *GEB* remains the deepest meditation on intelligence and consciousness I've encountered. These aren't AI books per se, but they're books that help you think about AI in context.

**Thinking in Systems** — Donella Meadows

Classic introduction to systems thinking principles and their application to complex problems. Explains feedback loops, leverage points, and system archetypes through clear examples. Provides tools for understanding interconnected challenges from ecology to economics. Essential for grasping how components interact to create emergent behaviors, highly relevant for understanding AI systems' societal impacts.

**Thinking, Fast and Slow** — Daniel Kahneman
