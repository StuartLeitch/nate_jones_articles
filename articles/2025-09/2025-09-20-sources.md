Some weeks matter more than others.

This week shaped the infrastructure we’re all going to compute with for the next half decade. And we got our first superhuman AI performance on any technical task.

The numbers tell the story: $100 billion in corporate restructuring, $5 billion in historic partnerships, $4 billion in datacenter investments, and $500 million revenue milestones.

But behind those figures is a bigger shift—AI companies are growing up, choosing collaboration over competition, and governments are finally saying "we're ready to handle this responsibly."

**The headlines:**

- NVIDIA and Intel buried the hatchet and are looking to put AI everywhere
- Microsoft beat the DeepSeek narrative and is going back to building
- Google gave Chrome a real brain (I am struggling not to Pinocchio reference here)
- Notion launched heavyweight AI agents that do real work
- Meta shipped $800 glasses and flubbed the demo ([my TikTok reaction](https://www.tiktok.com/@nate.b.jones/video/7551289346515586335?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7538887285418804791))
- OpenAI launched new ChatGPT Codex and won a coding competition ([my take here](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/forget-claude-vs-codex-the-14-ai?r=1z4sm5))
- Ireland jumped in the pool as the first country to really regulate AI seriously

This wasn't just a busy news week—it was the week AI became infrastructure. The experimental phase is over. This week is a sneak peek at what happens when AI is everywhere, governed properly, and built into the tools billions of people use every day.

Dig in for the full story!


## **Story 1: NVIDIA-Intel Strategic Partnership**

**What happened:** NVIDIA invested $5 billion in Intel stock to jointly develop AI infrastructure, with Intel manufacturing custom x86 CPUs with NVIDIA NVLink integration and x86 SoCs featuring NVIDIA RTX chiplets.

**Who's involved:**

- NVIDIA: Providing $5B investment, AI computing stack, and CUDA architecture
- Intel: Contributing x86 ecosystem, manufacturing capabilities, and process technology
- Jensen Huang and Lip-Bu Tan: CEOs calling it a "historic collaboration"

**Why it matters:**

- Ends decades of competition in favor of "co-opetition" for AI infrastructure
- Combines Intel's manufacturing scale with NVIDIA's AI dominance
- Signals that AI capital requirements exceed what single companies can handle alone
- Creates unified platforms optimized for both data center and consumer AI workloads
- Unlocks a local LLM future

**What to watch:** Regulatory approval timeline and first product releases. This partnership model could inspire similar alliances between traditional competitors as AI infrastructure demands grow.

## **Story 2: Microsoft Wisconsin AI Datacenter Expansion**

**What happened:** Microsoft announced an additional $4 billion Wisconsin investment, bringing total state commitment to $7 billion for two AI datacenters housing hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell GB200 GPUs.

**Who's involved:**

- Microsoft: $7B total investment across two facilities
- Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation: Facilitating partnerships and workforce development
- University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee: Receiving $500K for AI Co-Innovation Lab

**Why it matters:**

- Creates "world's most powerful AI datacenter" as distributed training supercomputer
- Demonstrates AI infrastructure as regional economic development driver
- Shows commitment to domestic AI computing capacity amid global competition
- Generated 10,000 construction jobs with 800 permanent positions
- Contradicts “no more investment” Microsoft narrative post DeepSeek

**What to watch:** Timeline execution (first facility early 2026, second 2027-2028) and whether other states can compete for similar mega-investments. This sets precedent for AI infrastructure as state economic strategy.

## **Story 3: Google Chrome Gemini Integration**

**What happened:** Google embedded Gemini AI directly into Chrome with ten features including AI Mode, page summarization, and upcoming "agentic" cursor control, rolling out to 3+ billion users.

**Who's involved:**

- Google: Integrating Gemini across Chrome, Calendar, YouTube, Maps
- Chrome users: Initially US English, expanding globally
- Competing AI browser startups: Arc, Perplexity, others face established platform challenge

**Why it matters:**

- Brings AI to world's most-used browser rather than requiring separate AI apps
- Integration strategy beats standalone application approach for mass adoption
- Challenges emerging AI-first browser companies by embedding in existing user habits
- Represents platform incumbents' AI defense strategy
- See how quick the team evolves this agent vs. other browsers!

**What to watch:** User adoption rates and global rollout speed. Success could kill standalone AI browser startups while failure opens opportunity for AI-native alternatives.

## **Story 4: Notion AI Agent Launch**

**What happened:** Notion 3.0 launched autonomous AI agents that execute 20-minute workflows, create content, manage databases, and integrate across tools while learning user preferences through editable memory profiles.

**Who's involved:**

- Notion: Crossing $500M annual revenue milestone
- Enterprise clients: Pfizer, Mitsubishi, Volvo Cars driving adoption
- Productivity software competitors: Microsoft, Google facing AI-first challenge

**Why it matters:**

- AI agents getting into complex multi-step business workflows autonomously
- Memory and personalization features address key limitations of previous AI assistants
- $500M revenue milestone shows AI-driven productivity tools reaching enterprise scale
- Notion really moving to AI-native at this point
- Reinforces Notion’s awkward position between SAAS and model makers

**What to watch:** Custom Agent rollout to "several hundred customers" and enterprise adoption metrics. Success validates autonomous AI agent market for workplace productivity.

## **Story 5: Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses Launch**

**What happened:** Meta shipped $799 AR glasses with built-in display, Neural Band muscle-signal control, real-time translation, and integration across Meta's app ecosystem, marking first consumer-ready AR platform.

**Who's involved:**

- Meta: Hardware and software integration
- Ray-Ban/EssilorLuxottica: Design and retail partnership
- Qualcomm: Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 chipset
- Retail partners: Best Buy, LensCrafters, Verizon, Ray-Ban stores

**Why it matters:**

- First AR glasses with practical daily utility beyond tech demos (we hope)
- Neural Band represents breakthrough in non-invasive brain-computer interfaces
- $799 price point makes AR accessible beyond early adopters
- Integration strategy leverages existing app ecosystem for immediate utility
- Closest attempt yet to crack the mythical 3rd form factor (beyond the phone)

**What to watch:** September 30 US launch reception and early 2026 international expansion. Consumer adoption will determine whether AR glasses achieve mainstream breakthrough or remain niche.

## **Story 6: OpenAI-Microsoft Corporate Realignment**

**What happened:** OpenAI's nonprofit arm received a $100 billion equity stake in the for-profit OpenAI PBC while restructuring revenue sharing with Microsoft from 20% currently down to just 8% by 2030.

**Who's involved:**

- OpenAI: Balancing nonprofit mission with commercial growth demands
- Microsoft: Accepting reduced revenue share in exchange for OpenAI's continued growth
- OpenAI nonprofit board: Receiving massive equity stake to maintain mission alignment

**Why it matters:**

- OpenAI successfully negotiated down Microsoft's revenue share by betting on massive future growth
- $100B nonprofit equity stake preserves mission-driven governance as company scales
- Signals OpenAI's confidence that 8% of 2030 revenue > 20% of current revenue
- Reduces OpenAI's dependence on Microsoft while maintaining strategic partnership
- Buries the hatchet and lets both teams focus on other things
- Reinforces huge growth expectations on both sides
- Sets precedent for how AI companies can restructure as they mature

**What to watch:** Revenue growth trajectory that justifies the reduced percentage deal and how the nonprofit stake influences company decisions. Success validates OpenAI's bet on explosive AI market growth through 2030.
