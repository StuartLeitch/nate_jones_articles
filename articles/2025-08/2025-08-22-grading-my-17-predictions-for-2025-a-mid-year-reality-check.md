*Right now, you're drowning in AI predictions. Every day brings another breathless announcement about how AI will revolutionize everything. Most of us tune it out. Heck, I tune it out too. And roll my eyes.*

*How do you separate what's actually happening from pure hype?*

*Well around here I like to be up front about what I’m getting right and what I’m missing. That's where this honest scorecard comes in. Eight months ago, I put my credibility on the line with [17 specific predictions about 2025](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/17-predictions-for-2025-the-year). Not vague hand-waving about "AI transformation," but concrete predictions. Stuff that’s falsifiable. I wanted to hold myself accountable.*

*The clock hasn’t run out on 2025, but I thought it was time for a little checkup. What hit already, what partially landed, and what completely flopped? Yes, even though there’s time on the clock I think we can say a few of these are probably flops lol*

*Here's what you'll learn from my successes and failures:*

***First, you'll get a reality filter for AI hype.** When I tell you AI companions are already a $120 million market but smart mirrors are going nowhere, you can adjust your own strategies accordingly. These aren't theoretical musings—this is what's actually happening in August 2025.*

***Second, you'll understand the "jaggedness" of AI adoption.** One of my biggest insights is that AI transformation isn't uniform—it's happening in dramatic pockets while other areas remain untouched. Knowing which is which could save you from betting on the wrong trend.*

***Third, you'll learn to spot patterns that matter.** My misses are arguably more valuable than my hits. I completely missed that 2025 would be the year of AI coding, that people would form emotional attachments to specific LLM versions, and that open-source models would explode. If I—someone obsessively tracking this space—missed these, you might be missing them too.*

*The stakes? We're in the middle of the fastest technological transformation in history. We need to learn pattern matching, how to see actual trends, how to keep ourselves honest. I’m trying to model it here.*

*So let me show you what I got right, what I got sorta ok right, and what I just got wrong. And let’s learn together how to think more accurately about the future along the way…*


# Grading My 17 Predictions for 2025: A Mid-Year Reality Check

Back in January, I put my money where my mouth is and laid out 17 predictions for 2025. Now, eight months into the year, it's time for some brutal honesty about what's working and what isn't. Because I believe in transparency, I'm going through every single prediction with a clear grading rubric—and you can push back if you think I'm being too generous (or too harsh) with myself.

Here's the breakdown: Out of 17 predictions, I'm calling 7 home runs, 6 partial hits, and 4 complete misses. That's a 41% hit rate, 35% partial credit, and 24% strikeout rate. Not perfect, but not terrible for trying to predict the wild world of AI.

Let's dive into all 17, starting with the wins.


## The Hits: 7 Predictions That Landed


### 1. AI Creators Come Out of the Closet

**Original prediction:** We'll see AI characters and creators compete with human creators, with several popular AI OnlyFans accounts emerging.

**Grade: HIT**

This one absolutely happened. AI OnlyFans creators are now earning $10,000+ per month with reported 312% revenue growth—and those numbers are probably much higher now. We're seeing AI-native creative agencies openly marketing their AI usage as a selling point, not hiding it. Major platforms are allowing AI content because, frankly, it's sticky and engaging.

The cultural shift I predicted—from shame to pride about using AI—has fully materialized. Creators aren't just admitting AI involvement; they're building it into their brand identity.


### 2. Your Feed Goes Synthetic

**Original prediction:** More than 50% AI content in Instagram feeds by year-end 2025.

**Grade: HIT**

We're at 38.5% of Instagram feeds being heavily AI-influenced already, between creative elements using AI and full AI creators. Meta has deeply integrated AI content generation tools into their platforms, and increasingly, users can't distinguish AI from human content.

The advances in image and video generation this year have been staggering. Have you seen Google's Genie 3? It generates immersive worlds as you navigate them—the world literally doesn't exist until you go there, then it appears. Google even has a tiny LLM navigating worlds created by another LLM. An AI living in the mind of another AI. I didn't predict that specific twist, but boy, would have been cool if I did.


### 3. The Revenge of Audio

**Original prediction:** We'll get personalized AI companion voices like in the movie "Her."

**Grade: HIT**

OpenAI's voice assistant has been explicitly compared to "Her" throughout 2025. We have contextually aware AI voice systems being deployed. Emotional AI voice companions are becoming mainstream.

This prediction was such a hit that when ChatGPT-5 came out and the voice changed, people complained. They wanted the old 4.0 voice back because they'd formed attachments to it. That's how you know voice AI has truly arrived—when people get upset about losing their preferred AI voice.


### 4. Your New Colleague Is An AI (Non-Tech)

**Original prediction:** AI adoption spreads beyond tech into traditional industries.

**Grade: HIT**

45% of US workers now report using AI tools at work. AI adoption is spreading beyond tech into traditional industries at an accelerating pace. While we're not at the point where every company has an AI you can tag in Slack, many companies do. If that feels like science fiction to you, that's more a function of your company context than where the tech actually is.


### 5. Visual AI Unicorn (Companionship)

**Original prediction:** A visual AI unicorn with widespread adoption, probably around relationships/companionship.

**Grade: HIT**

Digital girlfriends and boyfriends are absolutely a thing now. Grok's visual companions are rolling out on a massive scale. The AI companion market as a whole is hitting $120 million+ per year with widespread adoption and exploding growth. This trend is only going to accelerate in the remaining four months of the year.


### 6. Memory Changes Everything

**Original prediction:** AI will get "unlimited memory" that feels like it remembers months of context.

**Grade: HIT**

ChatGPT launched unlimited memory exactly as I predicted. We now have Claude investing in memory too. Cross-conversation memory is happening. AI agents with different memory strategies are proliferating. They're using "lossy math" approaches to approximate human memory, and it feels like magic.

This is one of the defining AI transformations of 2025. By year's end, we'll have even better memory features across more LLMs and agents.


### 7. The Great Authentication Crisis

**Original prediction:** Perfect deepfakes would cause authentication crises, with a CEO potentially being voice-cloned for fraud.

**Grade: HIT**

Perfect deepfakes are now trivially easy to create. Identity verification is becoming a massive issue. We're having to go to greater and greater lengths to prove our identity.

My specific prediction about a CEO being defrauded through voice cloning from earnings calls? I can't definitively prove it's happened yet—though I wonder if companies would even report it if it did. But the overall trend is absolutely in my favor. We have all the building blocks on the table in August 2025 for this to happen.


## The Partials: 6 Predictions Half-Right


### 8. AI Joins the Party (Literally)

**Original prediction:** AI-human meetups and dating platforms launching.

**Grade: PARTIAL**

AI-human dating platforms are launching. Virtual companions in social settings are starting to happen. But the blocker here is actually social etiquette, not technology. We need a breakthrough app that makes it socially acceptable to bring your digital companion to lunch with the parents.

Am I doubling down? Yes. This is coming, whether it sounds weird or not.


### 9. The "AI Skills" Ultimatum

**Original prediction:** AI literacy becomes a job requirement with workplace divisions over adoption.

**Grade: PARTIAL**

AI literacy is becoming a job requirement for some roles, not all. Workplaces are starting to divide over AI adoption. Training programs are proliferating.

What makes this partial is that it's happening in particular sectors of the economy, not economy-wide. AI transformation is as jagged as AI intelligence itself—something I didn't fully appreciate in January. I'm betting this jaggedness continues, with pockets of radical transformation alongside pockets of minimal change.


### 10. Big Tech's Agent Fiasco

**Original prediction:** Billions in market cap losses from agent failures.

**Grade: PARTIAL**

I predicted someone would get agents so wrong there'd be billions in market cap losses. Can't prove that specifically happened (though companies might not advertise such losses).

But the larger trend is clear: Big tech leaned heavily on the agent hype train, and we're seeing major pullback. 40% of AI agent projects are likely to be canceled by 2027. We've had very public failures. Gartner predicts widespread agent shakeout.

As someone bullish on agents long-term, I see this as the classic hype cycle—we're heading for the trough of disillusionment before reaching the plateau of productivity. The problem? The number of people who can successfully implement production agents is maybe a tenth of the demand.


### 11. The Hardware Plot Twist

**Original prediction:** OpenAI would release a non-phone hardware device in 2025.

**Grade: PARTIAL**

OpenAI is confirmed to be developing a hardware device with Jony Ive—pocket-sized, not a phone. But it's delayed until 2026 at the earliest. I'm giving myself partial credit because the project exists, but I was off on timing. I'm doubling down that this will happen, just later than predicted.


### 12. The AGI Debate Gets Weird

**Original prediction:** We'd have AI with IQ scores of 180-220 but still no consensus on AGI.

**Grade: PARTIAL**

AI systems are achieving high IQ scores yet failing basic tests. Andrej Karpathy famously called out that AI sometimes doesn't realize 9.11 is smaller than 9.89—it just doesn't look that way if you're not doing actual math.

The debate is absolutely getting weirder with each release. But I'm backing away from AGI being as central as I positioned it. AGI definitions might matter less than I thought, even as the debate continues to get weird.


### 13. AI Safety Gets Personal

**Original prediction:** Boom in AI-off spaces and AI detox programs.

**Grade: PARTIAL**

There's early motion here—AI-off spaces and detox programs are emerging. Public health implications of over-affirming AI are getting reported. Personal AI boundaries are becoming a conversation topic. AI companions are becoming an issue in human romantic relationships.

But it's not fully realized yet. I was too ahead of the curve. This feels more like a 2026-2027 phenomenon to get truly widespread.


## The Misses: 4 Predictions That Flopped


### 14. The AI Labor Question

**Original prediction:** AI consciousness activism disrupting board meetings.

**Grade: MISS**

While people certainly discuss AI consciousness, it's remained mostly academic and in chat rooms. No board meeting disruptions. No activists demanding AI labor rights at shareholder meetings. I just didn't correctly predict this one. The consciousness conversation exists, but not as the disruptive force I imagined.


### 15. The Smart Mirror Renaissance

**Original prediction:** Major investment in smart mirrors for visual AI applications.

**Grade: MISS**

We've had a few fitness and health applications, but no major breakthrough. Smart mirrors aren't on track to become household products. I thought people would want visual AI for trying on outfits and getting exercise feedback. The laundry-folding robot I saw recently looks way too expensive to be practical. I was just wrong on this one, and I'm not doubling down.


### 16. Humanoid Robots' iPhone Moment

**Original prediction:** Robot commercials at Super Bowl 2026.

**Grade: MISS**

I still have time on the clock for the Super Bowl commercial, but broadly speaking, we don't have the iPhone moment for robots. We're still "a year or two away," as we have been for a while. Production robots exist but remain too expensive and impractical for most households. I was too early on this one.


### 17. AI Weddings

**Original prediction:** Someone would attempt a human-AI wedding.

**Grade: MISS**

Despite all the companionship developments, I've seen zero traction on AI weddings anywhere in the world. No legal frameworks. No countries stepping up to offer them. Nobody's gone viral claiming they want to marry their AI.

The companionship trend is real and sticking around, but weddings? I jumped in the water way too early on that one.


## What I Wish I'd Predicted

Looking back, there are three massive trends I completely missed:

**1. LLM Affinity:** I should have predicted the emotional attachment people would form to specific LLM versions. When ChatGPT-5 rolled out and people demanded 4.0 back, I had all the ingredients there—I talked about companionship and emotional bonding. Should have seen it coming.

**2. The Year of Code:** AI and code has been THE story of 2025, with massive investment from every major lab. I didn't connect the dots between code and agents, or see how central code would be to flagship releases. All the ingredients were on the table.

**3. The Open Source Explosion:** I completely missed the proliferation of open-source models. There are now hundreds of excellent open-source models, including incredible American, European, and Chinese models you can run locally. I should have better predicted how quickly LLM technology would proliferate beyond the major labs.


## The Final Score

So there you have it: 41% hits, 35% partials, 24% complete misses.

When you're trying to predict the future of AI—a field moving at breakneck speed with jagged, unpredictable progress—I'll take those numbers. The hits captured fundamental shifts in how humans interact with AI. The partials identified real trends that are manifesting differently or more slowly than expected. And the misses? Well, they teach humility about predicting exponential change.

What do you think I graded wrong? What trends am I still missing? Let me know—because if 2025 has taught me anything, it's that the wildest predictions might not be wild enough.

Hopefully I learn from my predictions and get the 2026 slate better…
