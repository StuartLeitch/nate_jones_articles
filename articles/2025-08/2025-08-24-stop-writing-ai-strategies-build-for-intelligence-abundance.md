*MIT just [published the number](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) everyone's talking about: 95% of generative AI pilots fail to achieve rapid revenue acceleration. Ninety-five percent.*

*No surprise here.*

*I can count on more than all my fingers and toes the number of CTOs and CEOs who've sat down and told me versions of this same story this year: "We spent millions on AI transformation initiatives. Everyone is using the chatbot. But I can't tell if it does anything. Is it adding value? Our AI strategy looks good on paper but I can't show the board it moved the needle."*

*Meanwhile, MidJourney generates $200 million annually with eleven employees. That's $18 million per person. Lovable is over $100M ARR with a tiny team.*

*Sure, I can hear you say: that’s AI startups for you.*

*Nope. It’s not just small AI-native teams getting into AI revenue acceleration. Here are a few publicly traded firms with substantial AI-related growth: ServiceNow (21%YoY growth in automations), Palantir (39% revenue growth YoY), or even Jabil ($7.5B in hardware AI revenue added for fiscal 2025). Even Stryker (healthtech) is back on track toward double-digit growth after pivoting via acquisition (Care.ai). Shopify has very publicly gone all-in on AI.*

*These are all very different businesses and different strategies, but they have one thing in common: **they’ve managed to pivot to AI at scale.***

***Meanwhile, the 95%.** Meanwhile, most businesses can’t show real value from their AI projects, let alone revenue acceleration.*

*The gap between these realities is widening exponentially, and most executives don't understand why.*

*Here's the truth: **at root, the gap comes down to how these organizations process information and intelligence.** Most leaders are trying to bolt AI onto structures built for intelligence scarcity—hierarchies that were literally designed when information moved at the speed of sailing ships. Your middle managers exist to filter information. Your meetings exist to transfer knowledge between departments. Your approval chains exist because executives couldn't see the full picture in real-time.*

*Now we have systems that can process every signal simultaneously. And what do we do? We feed that intelligence into structures that compress it back down for human consumption. We're putting Formula One engines in horse-drawn carriages.*

*The companies pulling ahead aren't implementing AI strategies. That’s not the secret. They're rebuilding for intelligence abundance. They’re figuring out how to make decisions in hours that normally take weeks. They are increasingly their pace of iteration to daily or weekly while you move on a quarterly beat and schedule meetings to discuss changes.*

*I wrote this to give you a blueprint for rebuilding how information flows in your business so you can actually become AI native from the ground up.*

***What you'll find below:***

1. ***Why most AI initiatives are designed to fail**—the organizational antibodies that guarantee that 95% failure rate, backed by MIT's data and real examples*
2. ***The three fundamental shifts that separate the 5% who succeed**—not technology changes, but architectural rebuilds of how data flows, decisions get made, and value gets created*
3. ***A reality-grounded roadmap for transformation**—not aspirational timelines, but the exact sequence of changes that must happen to rebuild for intelligence abundance*

*This isn't another AI strategy guide, because you don’t need another AI strategy. It's a blueprint for recognizing that intelligence scarcity ended two years ago, and most organizations are still architected for the wrong era.*

*The successful 5% understand this. They've stopped asking "How do we implement AI?" and started asking "Given 100x more intelligence, what should we rebuild?"*

*The answer to that question changes everything.*

# Stop Writing AI Strategies. Build for Intelligence Abundance.


## No really, stop writing AI strategies

Seventy to eighty-five percent of AI initiatives never reach production. We've all seen the headlines—MIT's recent study puts the failure rate at 95% for pilots that don't achieve rapid revenue acceleration. But here's what those statistics miss: these initiatives aren't failing because of technical problems or talent gaps or even budget constraints.

They're failing because they put AI at the center.

I know that sounds backwards. Everyone's racing to implement AI, to show the board they have "an AI strategy," to hire that Chief AI Officer who will somehow transform everything. But that's exactly the trap. When you build an AI strategy—a bolt-on plan with its own budget, leader, and roadmap—you're preserving the very structures that make AI impossible to scale.

The real question isn't "How do we implement AI?"

It's "Given 100x more intelligence, what should we do differently to serve our customers?"

That shift in framing changes everything. Because once you understand that we've moved from intelligence scarcity to intelligence abundance—something that happened roughly two years ago—you realize that most of your organization is architected for the wrong era.


## Corporate history: how companies evolved to process information

Let me take you back to the age of sailing ships and the Dutch East India Company. When corporations first emerged, they faced a fundamental problem: intelligence moved at the speed of wind. You couldn't get information from headquarters to a remote production site in time to make decisions. So they invented the "factor"—a person stationed on-site who could make intelligent decisions locally.

That's where we get the word "factory," by the way. A physical manifestation of distributed intelligence.

Fast forward three hundred years, and what do we have? Managers. Department heads. Entire hierarchies built to filter information up and push decisions down. Jeff Bezos's famous two-pizza teams. All of it based on the same assumption: intelligence is scarce and expensive, so we need to distribute it carefully through human proxies.

Every management theory you learned in business school—empowering front-line workers, pushing decision-making down, creating autonomous teams—assumes intelligence scarcity. Your bi-weekly meeting where sales briefs engineering on upcoming contracts? That exists because humans couldn't efficiently process all contract data to identify product requirements. Your middle managers who synthesize reports for the C-suite? They're human compression algorithms, reducing complexity to something a few executives can digest.

Now imagine dumping 100x more intelligence into this system.

It's like installing a Formula One engine in a horse-drawn carriage. The structure can't handle the power. Worse, it actively rejects it.


## Adding AI to old management structures doesn’t work

When you bolt AI onto existing structures, something predictable happens. The organization develops antibodies.

I see this pattern everywhere. The AI Center of Excellence becomes an ivory tower, isolated from operations. It does impressive work that never quite connects to the business. The Chief AI Officer, if not properly empowered and integrated, becomes a single point of failure—everyone assumes AI is "their job" and abdication sets in across the organization. That separate AI budget you carved out? It's now competing with business unit budgets, creating resentment. In traditional management theory, budget equals power. So when AI gets budget, managers see it as power being taken away.

These aren't bugs. They're features of a system protecting itself.

The data backs this up. MIT just released a comprehensive study of 300 enterprise AI deployments, and the numbers are sobering. Ninety-five percent of generative AI pilots fail to achieve rapid revenue acceleration. But dig deeper into their research and you find something fascinating.

---


### **Sidebar: Why 95% of Companies Are Failing (MIT Study)**

The successful 5% aren't using better models. They're not spending more. In fact, they're doing something counterintuitive: they're buying more and building less. MIT found a 67% success rate for purchased AI solutions versus 33% for internal builds.

Why? Because purchased solutions force organizations to adapt their processes to the tool, not the other way around. When you build internally, you typically architect AI to fit your existing structures—the very structures built for intelligence scarcity. You end up automating inefficiency.

MIT researcher Aditya Challapally puts it bluntly: generic tools like ChatGPT work for individuals but fail in enterprises because "they don't learn from or adapt to workflows." But that's not the real insight. The real insight is that your workflows were designed assuming intelligence scarcity. When AI can't adapt to them, that's not AI's failure—it's evidence that your workflows shouldn't exist in their current form.

The study also uncovered widespread "shadow AI"—employees secretly using unsanctioned tools because official AI initiatives aren't meeting their needs. This isn't insubordination. It's proof that intelligence abundance is inevitable. Your employees already know they need 100x more intelligence to do their jobs well. They're finding it wherever they can.

The companies in the successful 5% share three characteristics: they pick one painful bottleneck and execute completely, they empower line managers rather than central AI teams, and most importantly, they're willing to redesign entire workflows rather than preserve existing structures.

In other words, they're not implementing AI strategies. They're rebuilding for intelligence abundance.

---

This pattern of organizational rejection isn't new. McKinsey found that only 1% of companies have achieved what they call "AI maturity." I think they’re broadly correct. And that’s not because 99% of companies are technically incompetent. It's because 99% are trying to graft intelligence onto structures built for its absence.


## Rethinking your business around intelligence scarcity

Here's what most executives miss: adding intelligence to structures built for intelligence scarcity doesn't enhance them—it breaks them.

Think about what ChatGPT-5 Pro just demonstrated. It can process information in parallel, analyzing multiple perspectives simultaneously in ways that would take human teams weeks. But to leverage this, you can't just hand it your existing data. Organizations are scrambling to restructure information into formats AI can actually consume—what I call data tokenization. They're discovering that their carefully organized hierarchies and processes are actually barriers to intelligence flow.

This isn't a technical problem. It's an architectural one.

When intelligence is scarce, you need:

- Managers to filter information
- Meetings to synthesize complexity
- Departments to coordinate activities
- Processes to sample reality and simplify it

When intelligence is abundant, these become bottlenecks. They're cholesterol in your organizational arteries, blocking the flow of intelligence that could be transforming your business.


## Building companies for intelligence abundance

While traditional companies struggle with 85% failure rates, there's another story playing out. Midjourney generates $200 million annually with eleven employees. That's $18 million per person—not per department, per person.

These AI-native companies aren't just using AI well. They're architected differently. Remove AI from Midjourney or Perplexity, and there's no company left. AI isn't helping humans do jobs—it is the job. Every customer interaction makes the product better for everyone else automatically. Pricing changes, feature updates, and customer routing happen based on data, not committee meetings.

The difference isn't that they have better AI. It's that they built for intelligence abundance from day one.

They don't have standing meetings to transfer information between departments—AI handles that continuously. They don't have management layers whose primary job is filtering and synthesis—algorithms do that in real-time. They don't have processes that exist solely to reduce complexity for human consumption—machines process the full complexity directly.


## Three Changes to Rebuild for Intelligence Abundance

So how do you move from bolt-on to built-in? How do you redesign for intelligence abundance when you're already running a business built for its scarcity?


### 1. Data Tokenization for AI Consumption

Most organizations don't understand what's happening with ChatGPT-5 Pro and (soon to be) future similar systems. We are moving to a fundamentally parallel future. These AIs process information in parallel, analyzing multiple perspectives simultaneously. But here's the problem: your data wasn't built for this. It was built for sequential human consumption—reports, dashboards, summaries.

Data tokenization means restructuring information so AI can actually think with it, not just read it. This isn't just about cleaning your data or building better APIs. It's about creating entirely new data pipelines designed to feed AI multi-perspective, deeply structured information that lets AI see all angles at once. That’s pipeline work, dataset work, and a lot of complex evals and prompt configuration.

There are going to be trillion-dollar businesses built just on converting enterprise data into formats AI can actually use. But the real insight is this: when you tokenize data properly, your best people suddenly have access to complete, real-time information for every decision. They don't make fewer decisions—they make more decisions, better decisions, faster decisions. They touch the business more, not less.


### 2. People as Accelerators, Not Automation Targets

Here's what everyone gets wrong about AI and talent. They think it's a teeter-totter—either more AI means fewer people, or more people means less AI. That's intelligence scarcity thinking.

In intelligence abundance, your best people are accelerators. They should touch the business more with their taste and judgment, not less. AI doesn't replace them—it amplifies them. But this requires two uncomfortable changes.

First, you need both upskilling and fresh blood. Your domain experts need to become fluent in AI partnership, while you bring in AI-native talent who can learn your domain fast. Change your hiring requirements—do they really need three years of experience in X, or do you want someone sharp at AI with six months of experience who can learn at 10x speed? ([I wrote more about this here](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/executive-briefing-the-7-missing?r=1z4sm5).)

Second, kill your promotion culture. In a world of 100x intelligence, your best individual contributors should stay individual contributors—supercharged by AI, touching every critical decision. Management as an information filter is obsolete. If someone's primary value is summarizing data for the layer above, that role shouldn't exist. Your extraordinary people shouldn't have to become managers to be heroes.


### 3. Eliminating Intelligence Proxies

This is the existential one. The one that makes executives uncomfortable.

Most of your organizational structure exists as a proxy for intelligence. That bi-weekly meeting where sales briefs engineering on upcoming contracts? It exists because humans couldn't process all contract data to identify product requirements. An AI can do this continuously, in real-time, with perfect fidelity.

But it's not just meetings. Entire departments exist to coordinate activities that AI could handle automatically. Management layers exist to filter complexity. Approval chains exist because decision-makers couldn't see the full picture.

When you eliminate these intelligence proxies, something counterintuitive happens. You don't get less human involvement—you get more meaningful human contribution. Your people stop being information filters and start being value creators. They stop managing process and start driving outcomes.

The companies that can admit this—that structures they've depended on as the definition of work itself should not exist—are the ones we call AI-native. They make decisions incredibly quickly. They scale without proportional costs. They learn continuously.

Most organizations can handle the data work—it's technical but doable. They punt the people work to HR. But the structure work? That's where they freeze. Because it means admitting that using AI to take better meeting notes is exactly the wrong answer. The meeting itself is the problem.


## You might be late, but it’s not too late

Let me be direct about something most consultants won't tell you: if you're just starting to think about this now, you're already two years behind. The companies that are winning didn't start their AI journey with ChatGPT. They started rebuilding their organizations for intelligence abundance the moment GPT-3.5 showed what was possible.

But here's the harder truth: being behind is better than being wrong. Most of your competitors are still building AI strategies, creating Centers of Excellence, hiring Chief AI Officers. They're institutionalizing their disadvantage. Every month they spend perfecting their bolt-on approach is a month they're not rebuilding for abundance.

The gap compounds exponentially. A company operating with intelligence abundance makes decisions in hours that take intelligence-scarce organizations weeks. They iterate on products daily while you're still scheduling meetings to discuss changes. They're processing market signals and adapting before you've finished your quarterly review. In other words, getting this right means getting a sustainable advantage in speed.


## What actually works

When you redesign for intelligence abundance rather than bolting AI onto scarcity structures, something powerful happens. AI becomes a flywheel accelerator for your core business.

Instead of an AI strategy competing with your business strategy, intelligence amplifies everything you're already doing. Customer insights flow faster. Product development cycles compress. Market signals translate to action in hours instead of quarters. Your best people touch the business more frequently with higher-impact decisions.

The companies achieving this aren't necessarily the ones with the biggest AI budgets or the most PhDs. They're the ones who asked a different question. Not "What's our AI strategy?" but "If we had 100x more intelligence, how would we rebuild our business to serve customers better?"


## Quick steps

If you’re here and ready to take action, here’s where I’d start:

First, kill the AI strategy deck. Stop treating AI like a separate initiative with its own budget, leader, and success metrics. Instead, ask every business unit head to identify one workflow they'll completely redesign assuming unlimited intelligence. Not improve, not optimize—redesign from first principles.

Second, map your intelligence bottlenecks. Where do humans exist solely to filter, synthesize, or transfer information? Those are your transformation opportunities. Not because you'll eliminate those people, but because you'll free them to do work that actually requires human judgment, creativity, and relationship-building.

Third, change your metrics. Stop measuring AI ROI like an IT project. Start measuring decision velocity—how fast you go from signal to action. Track override rates—how often humans need to correct AI recommendations. Monitor KPI evolution—are your metrics changing as fast as your capabilities? And yes (thanks MIT) track revenue where it makes sense too.


## The choice is yours

Every industry has companies still organizing around "an AI strategy"—treating it as a bolt-on capability with a separate budget and leader. HBR has already documented how this single-leader model fails. BCG's research shows only 10-26% of companies get beyond proof-of-concept to real value. McKinsey puts true AI maturity at 1%.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

Right now there are companies redesigning themselves for intelligence abundance. They're achieving 10x productivity gains with 1/10th the headcount. They're making decisions in hours that used to take weeks. They're turning every customer interaction into a learning opportunity that improves the product for everyone.

The gap between these two groups is widening exponentially. Every month you spend in pilot purgatory, AI-native competitors are pulling further ahead. They're not reading reports about AI transformation. They're shipping products, serving customers, and compounding their intelligence advantage.

The age of intelligence scarcity in corporations lasted three hundred years, from the Dutch East India Company to roughly 2023. The age of intelligence abundance is two years old. Most organizations are still architected for the wrong era.

The winners won't be the companies with the best AI strategy. They'll be the ones who recognize that intelligence abundance isn't something you add to your business—it's something you rebuild your business around.

# Appendix: A Transformation Roadmap


## First, Understand What You're Actually Changing

It was really tempting to slap a bunch of timelines on here, but I didn’t. Forget timelines. Every organization moves at different speeds based on industry, regulation, and organizational debt. What matters is sequence—what has to change before what else becomes possible.

This is a mechanical roadmap because you are rebuilding the engine of your business, and the sequence and depth of your systemic changes needs to be correct to get an output that actually accelerates you forward.

You're not really implementing AI per se. That’s where a lot of people stop. They shouldn’t. You're rebuilding three interconnected systems: how information flows, how decisions get made, and how value gets created. Get the order wrong and you'll join the 95% failure rate.


## The Foundation: Data Liquidity

Nothing else works until your data can flow. Not "clean data" or "good data governance"—those are intelligence scarcity concepts. Data liquidity means information can move from source to decision without human intermediation.

Start by picking one critical decision your business makes repeatedly. Sales qualification. Credit approval. Inventory replenishment. Whatever drives your economics. Now trace the data journey: where does the information originate? How many systems does it touch? How many humans interpret, transfer, or transform it along the way?

Each human touchpoint is a liquidity blocker. Your first mechanical change: build pipes that let this data flow directly from source to AI processing. Not dashboards for humans to interpret. Not reports for managers to read. Direct data feeds that AI can consume continuously.

This will break things. Your existing approval processes assume human review. Your audit trails expect human signatures. Your compliance frameworks require human accountability. All of these need to be rebuilt for a world where AI processes information continuously and humans intervene by exception.


## The Second Layer: Decision Architecture

Once data flows, you need to rebuild how decisions get made. In intelligence scarcity organizations, decisions cascade through hierarchies. Information flows up, decisions flow down. Each layer exists to compress complexity for the layer above.

In intelligence abundance, this architecture is obsolete. AI can hold all the complexity simultaneously. It doesn't need compression. It needs decision rights.

Start with that same critical decision. Who currently makes it? More importantly, why them? Usually it's because they have experience, judgment, and access to information. AI now has access to all information. It can simulate experience through pattern recognition. What it lacks is judgment—the human ability to weigh factors that aren't in the data.

Your mechanical change: separate decision rights from information processing. AI processes all information and presents complete decision packages. Humans apply judgment on the complete picture, not filtered summaries. This means your senior people make more decisions, not fewer, but each decision takes seconds, not days.

This breaks traditional management. Middle managers who exist to filter and summarize have no role. Senior leaders who delegate because they lack bandwidth suddenly have capacity for 10x more decisions. Junior staff who were information gatherers need to become judgment developers.


## The Third Layer: Organizational Topology

With data flowing and decisions restructured, your organization shape becomes malleable. Traditional hierarchies exist to manage information flow and decision rights. When AI handles information flow and decisions happen in human-AI partnerships, what's left for the hierarchy to do?

The answer: almost nothing except the most crucial one-way door decisions. This is why AI-native companies don't have (as many) management layers. They have capability clusters—groups of humans with specific judgment capabilities that AI cannot replicate. Leaders are there to ungate, make very thoughtful decisions where needed, and act to accelerate the business. They don’t filter information.

Your mechanical change: stop organizing by function or business unit. Start organizing by decision domain. Customer value decisions. Product evolution decisions. Risk management decisions. Each domain gets a small team of humans with deep judgment capabilities partnered with AI systems that handle all information processing. Invest in your leaders, because you don’t learn this stuff in business school.

These teams don't need coordination meetings because AI maintains context across all domains. They don't need approval chains because decision rights are clear and AI ensures compliance. They don't need status reports because every decision is logged and visible.


## The Fourth Layer: Feedback Velocity

Traditional organizations learn slowly because feedback loops run through humans. Customer complaint to product change takes months. Market signal to strategy adjustment takes quarters. This made sense when processing feedback required human interpretation.

With intelligence abundance, feedback loops can run continuously. Every customer interaction can immediately influence product behavior. Every market signal can instantly adjust operations. But only if you rebuild your systems to enable this.

Your mechanical change: work to eliminate batch processing of feedback. This doesn’t mean killing all quarterly meetings, but it does mean pivoting those periodic touchpoints to focus on decisioning that matters at that cadence—not just convenient informational filtering. I’ve observed that more native AI businesses have very vew of those defined cadence conversations and a whole more people (yes people, not AI) deeply touching the business, leveraging AI signals intelligence to do so. The feedback loops are fast because the data is there and they are empowered to make decisions effectively.

This requires a fundamentally different risk tolerance. In a world of human-mediated feedback, you minimize risk by slowing down and checking everything. In a world of AI-mediated feedback, you minimize risk by speeding up and correcting rapidly. Your worst outcomes come from being slow, not from being wrong.


## The Fifth Layer: Value Creation Models

In intelligence scarcity organizations, value creation is linear. Inputs become outputs through defined processes. More value requires more inputs or better processes. This is why traditional companies scale linearly with headcount.

Intelligence abundance enables compound value creation. Every customer interaction makes your product better for all customers. Every decision improves your decision-making capability. Every process execution optimizes the process. But only if you architect for compound effects, and get your best people to touch the business more to drive that forward.

Your mechanical change: rebuild your business model around learning loops, not transaction flows. Instead of selling products, sell continuously improving outcomes. Instead of delivering services, deliver adaptive experiences. Instead of processing transactions, accumulate intelligence.

This isn't philosophical. It's mechanical. Your pricing model needs to reflect continuous improvement. Your customer contracts need to assume evolution. Your partner relationships need to enable data sharing. Your competitive moat becomes your accumulated intelligence, not your current capabilities.


## The Execution Reality

These changes can't happen simultaneously. They have dependencies. You can't rebuild decision architecture until data flows. You can't restructure your organization until decisions are reformed. You can't accelerate feedback until your organization can handle it. You can't create compound value until all the other pieces work.

Most companies try to do everything at once. They fail. Or they do things out of order. They fail. Or they do them partially. They fail.

The successful 5% understand this is a sequential rebuild of fundamental business mechanics. Each change enables the next. Skip one and the entire transformation stalls.


## The Hard Questions

Before you start, answer these honestly:

1. Can you accept that most of your organizational structure might be obsolete? Not inefficient. Obsolete. As irrelevant as telegraph operators after the telephone.
2. Will you let good people leave? Because many will (not because you fired them). They succeeded in the old system. They won't transition to the new one.
3. Can you tolerate being worse before you're better? Every mechanical change will temporarily reduce performance. You're rebuilding the engine while the car is driving.
4. Are you willing to be unemployable at other traditional companies? Once you've operated in intelligence abundance, you can't go back to intelligence scarcity. It's like asking someone who's used email to go back to postal mail.

If you answered no to any of these, keep your AI strategy. Build your Center of Excellence. Hire your Chief AI Officer. Join the 95% who fail comfortably and who watch the 5% with envy.

If you answered yes, then you’re probably read for the jump. The mechanical changes are clear. The sequence is defined. The only question is whether you'll act before your competitors make the choice irrelevant.
