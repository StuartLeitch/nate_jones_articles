*This is not another Taylor Swift post. This is a post about how AI is accelerating the end of a 20 year status quo in marketing, and what to do next. Even if you don’t work in marketing, this matters.*

*Because in the age of AI, we’re all gonna have to get better at marketing (at least) ourselves and our careers. The marketing paradox applies to all of us, and the strategies I outline here work for all of us too.*

*Because the current reality is unsustainable for everybody. It shows up in the job market (where we market ourselves). It shows up in marketing campaigns. The hard truth is AI is commodifying all the levers of marketing faster than I can write about it.*

*We can all create incredible videos now. The strategy that you have for transforming your marketing into an AI powerhouse is probably cut-and-paste what everyone else in your vertical is using. Same tools, same results ([same bat time, same bat channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckImOld/comments/pcq7pc/who_remembers_same_battime_same_batchannel/) for those of you from the TV era).*

*TLDR; there is no alpha in chasing tools to the bottom, and the 20 year marketing optimization status quo is starting to crack. This post is about what’s breaking and a way forward for marketers—whether you’re marketing yourself, your indie hacked startup, or you’re driving (or influencing) marketing strategy for a company.*

*In the next 18 months, every competitor will have access to AI that can generate Super Bowl-quality video for $2,000. Perfect product shots, flawless testimonials, and controversy-calibrated campaigns at the push of a button. The same tools that cost six figures today will be free tomorrow.*

*Want some examples? [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwR-SitEHQ0) aired during the NBA finals. [This one](https://adage.com/video/kalshi-world-gone-mad-30s/) from Kalshi aired on prime time. These are going to be dime-a-dozen by next year.*

*When everyone can create perfect content for nothing, what's actually worth something?*

*I've spent the last few months studying this shift. The Sydney Sweeney American Eagle controversy that generated 47 million views. The Taylor Swift deepfakes. Then of course the explosion of AI-generated ads that have that crazy wild anything-can-happen vibe. They're not isolated incidents. They're symptoms of a 20-year-old marketing optimization strategy that's finally breaking apart.*

*Marketing has been stuck in what’s called a local maxima—we've optimized ourselves into a corner where we're really good at one thing (driving engagement) but nobody has the tools or local incentives to break the status quo and evolve to something better. AI isn't just accelerating this problem. It's accelerating it so fast that the whole system is about to collapse.*

*That's actually good news if you understand what's happening.*

*There's a window right now—maybe 18 months—where understanding this shift provides real competitive advantage. The smartest brands are already moving, but quietly. They're not buying more AI tools. They're building what AI can't replicate.*

*Here's what's actually happening, why it breaks everything we know about marketing optimization, and what replaces engagement as the metric that matters.*


# AI Is Speeding Up Marketing's Race to the Bottom (And Why That's the Way Out)

We've been stuck optimizing for engagement for 20 years. AI just made the trap visible.

The convergence of AI and marketing reveals a system optimized into a corner. This exploration connects local maxima, algorithmic optimization, and celebrity culture to explain why Sydney Sweeney's calculated controversy, Taylor Swift deepfakes, and $2,000 AI-generated ads that look like million-dollar productions aren't separate phenomena—they're symptoms of the same system disease.

AI marketing is exploding. Approximately 40% of the Instagram feed is now AI-generated content, and this percentage is growing rapidly. Meta is investing heavily in AI tooling, recently publishing a billion-parameter artificial brain designed to measure user responses to videos and simulate them to create more targeted AI videos. These aren't just videos that might appeal to users—they're videos specifically engineered to trigger particular psychological responses.

Digital ads that cost a million dollars just a few years ago now cost a tenth of that price or less, with costs continuing to decline. Major brands are jumping on the AI-generated ad stream, and we can expect a significant share of Super Bowl 2026 advertisements to be AI-generated, at least in part.

Understanding this transformation requires grasping the concept of local maxima and how it applies to marketing optimization.


## Understanding Local Maxima

In optimization algorithms, systems use gradient descent to improve performance. The system evaluates its current position, examines every possible small change, and selects the modification that most improves its target metric. This process resembles adjusting thousands of radio knobs simultaneously to achieve the clearest signal.

The fundamental problem emerges when the system reaches a point where every small adjustment degrades performance. Any slight turn of any knob worsens the metric, leading the algorithm to conclude it has found the optimal solution. However, this represents only a local maxima. Superior solutions may exist, but reaching them would require dramatically different settings across all parameters. The algorithm cannot perceive these alternatives because it can only evaluate incremental changes.

Marketing has been trapped in a local maxima for approximately two decades.

Since social media's emergence, the industry has optimized relentlessly for engagement. Every small adjustment, A/B test, and algorithm tweak has pushed toward more clicks, extended time on site, and heightened emotional response. The gradient descent of marketing optimization has led to a specific destination: controversial, emotionally manipulative, attention-grabbing content that exploits human psychology.

The industry believes it has optimized marketing. Instead, it has optimized itself into a corner.


## The System We Built

The Sydney Sweeney American Eagle campaign exemplifies where this optimization has led. The brand deliberately courted controversy with "genes/jeans" wordplay—featuring a blonde, blue-eyed actress discussing inherited traits while modeling denim. CMO Craig Brommers admitted the campaign was designed to "push buttons."

This strategy isn't new. It mirrors the Brooke Shields Calvin Klein advertisements from the 1990s. Jeans are ubiquitous—everyone owns jeans. To market them effectively, brands must venture into controversy to differentiate themselves in a saturated market.

The difference now: AI makes this playbook trivially easy to execute. Brands can A/B test controversy at machine speed, generate thousands of variations until finding the perfect provocation, and model exactly which psychological triggers to activate for specific audience segments. The technology for creating advertisements and manufacturing controversy is converging while becoming dramatically cheaper.

Taylor Swift deepfakes represent the other side of this convergence. While deepfakes aren't new and aren't limited to Taylor Swift, her status as a prominent female celebrity creates special prevalence and visibility. Journalists routinely use Taylor Swift as a test case when investigating AI system safety, generating immediate global headlines when new features like Grok could theoretically create inappropriate images of her.

Testing this phenomenon directly on Midjourney reveals the current reality: AI-generated images of Taylor Swift in concert are indistinguishable from authentic photographer shots. Without context, determining whether an image represents an artistic photograph from an actual concert or complete fabrication becomes impossible. This represents our current reality: the inability to distinguish artificial tokens from authentic ones in advertising and other contexts.

The third element is the uncanny valley problem. Generation Z consistently expresses concern about authenticity in studies, yet they struggle equally to differentiate between high-quality AI-generated material and authentic content. This isn't generational—none of us can reliably make this distinction anymore. This inability to distinguish real from fake is accelerating dramatically.


## The Four Feedback Loops

AI systems are creating evolutionary pressure on human content creation. Artificial authenticity is beginning to outcompete genuine authenticity in algorithmic environments. This isn't happening through conscious design—it's emerging through four accelerating feedback loops.


### Sampling feedback loops

Controversial content receives broader distribution and creates training data biased toward more controversy. The Sydney Sweeney case demonstrates this precisely. The feedback loop samples successful content. Controversial content performs better in feeds, so the system generates more controversial content to accelerate this effect.

Society has broadly discussed how social media rewards outrage, but we haven't adequately addressed AI as an accelerant for this phenomenon. AI accelerates controversial content production by making it easier and cheaper to create. This reinforces the training data loop for algorithms. Every successful controversial campaign becomes training data for the next generation of AI tools, teaching them that controversy equals success.

This means we're literally training AI systems on datasets already biased toward manipulation and controversy. The AI isn't learning to create effective advertisements—it's learning to create controversial ones, because the data demonstrates controversy works.


### Feature feedback loops

User engagement with content creates algorithmic features. User engagement with manipulative content teaches algorithms that manipulation equals quality. This feedback loop isn't new, but AI accelerates it because AI produces content more likely to generate engagement—content humans are more likely to engage with.

Humans cannot distinguish the difference, returning to the uncanny valley concept. We cannot tell, so we click and engage, feeding both the content algorithm that serves us material and teaching marketers that AI works effectively. Every click becomes a vote for more of the same.

What's particularly insidious: we're not just training the algorithms—we're training ourselves. Our engagement patterns become the features defining "good" content for the system. If we rage-click on controversial content, the system learns that rage-clicking signals positive response. If we share deepfakes because they're shocking, the system learns that shock value equals virality.


### Individual feedback loops

Repeated exposure to optimized content changes our behavior and expectations. Extensive research documents how Instagram feeds affect self-image and social relationships. But this extends to parasocial relationships as well.

Much of the Taylor Swift phenomenon involves people believing they have a right to a relationship with her, even if it's fabricated in their minds. This isn't unique to Taylor Swift—it's the nature of modern celebrity. But AI is industrializing it.

Character AI and other AI companionship applications generate over $220 million annually with rapid growth. They cultivate parasocial relationships while allowing users to create their own characters. Users create the characters they'll have artificial relationships with. Traditional parasocial relationships at least involved real humans. Now we're forming emotional bonds with entities that never existed.

In both cases, AI accelerates this individual feedback loop, changing behavior and expectations based on engagement patterns. We're being trained to accept artificial relationships as real, to prefer manufactured intimacy over genuine connection.


### Outcome feedback loops

Successful AI content running through these feedback loops becomes the baseline for normal content. AI content isn't just changing what we consume and what appears in our feeds—it's changing how we create authentic video content.

Extensive research has examined how Hollywood filmmaking has shifted over the past 20-25 years with CGI. Similarly, authentic content creation—whether movies, advertisements, or marketing assets—is changing because of AI. We haven't fully processed this transformation, but we'll see shifts in camera angles, expectations for special effects capabilities, and expectations for integrating real people versus obviously artificial ones versus deepfakes so convincing we cannot distinguish them from humans.

We are reshaping the baseline of normal in our movies and advertisements through our interactions. The artificial becomes the template for the real. This represents perhaps the most profound feedback loop because even "authentic" content begins mimicking AI-generated content. Reality starts imitating artificiality.


## Emergent Behaviors Nobody Programmed

These four feedback loops—controversial content receiving more distribution, user engagement with manipulative content teaching algorithms that manipulation equals quality, repeated exposure changing our behavior, and outcomes reshaping our expectations of non-AI content—feed on each other while being accelerated by AI.

This produces emergent behaviors that nobody programmed.

This isn't about evil marketers conspiring to poison America or the world with their advertisements. That's a popular misconception. Having worked as a marketer with amazing marketing teams, that's simply not how marketers operate.

Instead, consider emergent behaviors in a system that is, as established from the beginning, locally optimized—a local maxima system. What we have is emergent optimization effectively designed to adapt human psychological conditioning to AI content.

To restate this clearly: AI systems optimizing for engagement inadvertently optimize human psychology for engagement with AI content. Nobody wants this outcome, but this is what we've achieved.

This represents the throughline connecting Sydney Sweeney, Taylor Swift, the uncanny valley, and parasocial relationships. The core thesis: our AI systems, built on top of engagement-optimized systems, are essentially adapting our psychology to engage with AI content.

This creates a profound problem. As marketers and brands, we claim to value authenticity. Humans buying products say they value authenticity. Between them, disintermediating that relationship, is an AI marketing system that values artificiality. It values what's fake.


## Why the Local Maxima Will Break

The local maxima won't hold forever, and this represents good news: AI intelligence and tooling continue becoming cheaper, meaning every brand will be able to create fantastic, unusual videos constantly.

We're approaching tremendous content flooding—all very high quality and all very AI-generated. The volume will exceed human consumption capacity. This creates a massive signal-to-noise problem. People won't be able to find meaningful signal.

Consider what happens when every brand can generate perfect controversy for pennies. When every company can create deepfake testimonials. When every product can have AI-generated social proof. The very optimization that created this situation—engagement through manipulation—becomes worthless when everyone has access to it.

This resembles an arms race where everyone acquires nuclear weapons simultaneously. Suddenly, the weapons don't provide advantages anymore. They just ensure mutual destruction.

This is already beginning. The cost of creating commercials that would have required million-dollar budgets is approaching zero. Kalshi produced a Super Bowl-quality advertisement for $2,000 in 48 hours using AI. Coign created the financial industry's first fully AI-generated commercial at 1% of traditional cost. When everyone can do this, what provides differentiation?


## What Can't Be Faked

The path through this involves brands emphasizing what cannot be faked with AI. The music industry provides an interesting example.

Consider Taylor Swift's new album launch. When Taylor Swift announced it on August 12th, she blurred the album image. This wasn't just for suspense. She values easter eggs and controlling her marketing narrative, and the live podcast blur likely ensured any AI fakes circulating afterward would be immediately, obviously fake. Taylor's strategy suggests that one path forward involves directly owning distribution and marketing. But Taylor's approach isn't just defensive. She's also pre-selling physical media. Vinyl is experiencing a significant comeback, and she's pre-selling the album vinyls.

Vinyls cannot be faked. They're real. You can touch them, hold them. This partially explains their comeback. One way good brands can cut through the noise involves doubling down on physical experiences that humans cannot obtain any other way.

AI cannot provide a vinyl of the Taylor Swift album in the same way that Taylor mailing the album on the correct date provides an irreplaceable human experience of opening the package and receiving the vinyl. This maintains authenticity that holds long-term customer value in a world where numerous brands demand attention.

This extends far beyond music. Whiskey distilleries are returning to physical customer proximity, offering distillery tours and special tasting rooms. For brands outside luxury goods, physical store footprints are evolving. While malls are no longer dominant in the US, and the controversy Sydney Sweeney courted with the jeans advertisement was primarily designed to drive attention and traffic to the American Eagle website for conversion, the key insight remains: if that's your strategy, you want to provide in-person experiences that leave people wanting to return for experiences they cannot get elsewhere.

The problem with controversy marketing (like American Eagle's approach) is that it buys stock price increases and attention. It undoubtedly generates sales—controversy works. But this approach doesn't necessarily translate into long-term customer value. For sustainable long-term customer value, which ultimately sustains free cash flows and business valuation, brands must figure out how to move people from AI spaces into physical spaces.

Physical experiences engage our complete senses—smell, touch, all the elements that make us register authentic experiences. They help build brand community with other human consumers. This builds those long-term customer relationships. Notice Taylor didn't just create one vinyl—she created multiple special editions with posters, really leaning into the physical aspect.

Brands can have fun with this. They can make it hybrid and online simultaneously. They can create Instagrammable moments, Instagram walls with special logos. But they still need that irreplaceable human touch.


## The Irreplaceability of Human Touch

As consumers begin demanding authenticity as a differentiator, we'll start seeing some kind of certificate of human touch in brand offerings.

The exact form remains unclear, but we can examine how the beauty industry has handled authenticity over the past 20 years and how beauty marketing has shifted accordingly. The journey from airbrushed perfection to celebrating real skin, real bodies, real faces took two decades in beauty. It's about to happen in 18 months everywhere else.

Similarly, we'll see marketing that leans into authentically portrayed human experiences. Marketing that says, "This is a real human. We didn't AI-enhance their face." Marketing that says, "This is a real car. A piece of it just fell off. We didn't pretend."

This will become increasingly common as a way to signal to consumers in a sea of AI content that you are worth attention. An anti-AI signal will emerge because AI content is becoming so cheap and easy to produce.

This isn't about nostalgia or luddism. It's about scarcity. When perfect becomes cheap, imperfect becomes valuable. When artificial is everywhere, authentic becomes luxury. When everything can be faked, the unfakeable becomes priceless.


## Three Additional Ways Forward

Beyond emphasizing physical experiences and certificates of human touch, brands have three other strategic paths for escaping the engagement-optimization trap.


### Radical Transparency as Differentiation

When AI can manufacture perfect narratives, radical transparency becomes a competitive advantage. This means showing the actual process—the failures, the iterations, the human decisions behind the brand. While AI can generate flawless origin stories, it cannot replicate the messy reality of how things actually get made.

Patagonia exemplifies this approach by documenting their supply chain challenges, environmental impact calculations, and internal debates about business decisions. When they tell customers not to buy their jacket unless they need it, the counterintuitive honesty cuts through the noise precisely because it cannot be algorithmically optimized. No AI system would recommend telling customers not to buy your product.

This extends beyond environmental messaging. Software companies can show their actual debugging processes, their failed feature launches, their customer complaint resolution. Food brands can document their recipe development failures alongside successes. The vulnerability of admitting "we tried this and it didn't work" becomes valuable precisely because AI systems are trained to present success narratives.

The key insight: AI optimizes for perfection, but human psychology often trusts imperfection more. When every brand can present a perfect story, the brand that shows its real story—with all the contradictions and compromises—becomes memorable.


### Community Co-Creation Over Broadcasting

The traditional marketing model broadcasts messages to audiences. AI amplifies this by enabling personalized broadcasting at scale. But genuine community co-creation cannot be automated because it requires real-time human judgment, empathy, and the ability to navigate complex social dynamics.

LEGO's Ideas platform demonstrates this approach. Instead of just marketing to LEGO fans, they've created a system where fans design sets, vote on concepts, and help shape the product line. The community doesn't just consume LEGO content—they create it. This relationship cannot be replicated by AI because it requires ongoing human negotiation, compromise, and collaborative decision-making.

This approach works across industries. Beauty brands can involve customers in shade development. Software companies can make users genuine partners in feature prioritization. Food brands can let communities vote on new flavors while sharing the actual development process.

The crucial difference from traditional focus groups or surveys: the community becomes genuinely invested in outcomes because they're co-creators, not just consulted consumers. AI can facilitate these interactions, but it cannot replace the human investment that emerges from genuine collaborative creation.


### Temporal Authenticity and Real-Time Experiences

AI excels at creating content that can be infinitely reproduced and optimized. But experiences that exist only in specific moments, that cannot be saved or replicated, create a different kind of value. This isn't just about live events—it's about creating meaning through temporal scarcity.

Clubhouse, before it became a victim of 2020 valuation pops, demonstrated this principle. Conversations happened in real-time and disappeared. The inability to replay or optimize these interactions created a different quality of attention and engagement. While Clubhouse ultimately failed to maintain this uniqueness, the principle remains sound.

Brands can create temporal authenticity through live problem-solving sessions, real-time design processes, or time-limited collaborative projects. The value comes not from the perfect execution but from the shared experience of working through something together in real-time, with all the uncertainty that entails.

A restaurant might broadcast their actual prep process live each morning, taking suggestions and adapting in real-time. A design studio might solve client problems live, showing the actual thinking process. A musician might compose in real-time based on audience input. These experiences cannot be optimized because they're happening now, with real constraints and real uncertainty.

The temporal element is crucial: these experiences lose their meaning if they're recorded and packaged. The value comes from being present for something that's happening once, with real stakes and real consequences.


### A Personal Marketing Aside: Applying This to Your Job Search

If you're marketing yourself—in job searches, freelance work, or building a personal brand—these same principles apply with particular urgency. The job market is being flooded with AI-optimized resumes, AI-written cover letters, and AI-generated portfolios. Standing out requires emphasizing what AI cannot replicate about you.

Your unfakeable elements aren't your skills listed on LinkedIn—those can be copied. They're your specific problem-solving approaches, your particular way of thinking through challenges, and your real work process. Instead of listing "managed cross-functional teams," document a specific instance where you navigated a real conflict between departments, including what didn't work the first time.

Create temporal authenticity in your job search. Offer to solve a real problem for the company during the interview process—not spec work, but genuine thinking through their actual challenges in real-time. Most candidates optimize their presentation for the interview. Instead, demonstrate your actual thinking process, including the dead ends and reconsiderations.

Build genuine community around your expertise. Rather than broadcasting your qualifications, engage in real problem-solving in professional communities. Help people work through challenges in your field without immediately positioning yourself for opportunities. This cannot be replicated by AI because it requires sustained human judgment and genuine care about outcomes beyond your own advancement.

Most importantly, resist the urge to optimize your personal brand for algorithmic engagement. The same feedback loops that trap marketing also trap personal branding. The LinkedIn post that gets 10,000 likes but says nothing meaningful about your actual capabilities is a local maxima. The hiring manager who eventually matters isn't looking for viral content—they're looking for evidence of genuine competence and trustworthy judgment.

Document your real work process, including the unsuccessful approaches. Show your actual thinking, not your polished conclusions. Engage in genuine professional relationships rather than networking optimization. These approaches take longer but create the kind of professional reputation that survives algorithmic changes and stands out in an AI-saturated market.

## What Builders Are Missing

For AI tool builders creating marketing solutions: most development has focused on the toolchain for producing advertisements. You've been building cleaner, simpler pathways from idea to advertisement. That pathway is fairly well-established.

There's significant untapped space in using AI to help marketers exercise good taste and judgment regarding optimal long-term brand positioning and the best long-term positioning for particular ad campaigns that support the brand.

Precious little AI work has addressed the connection between content, branding, and long-term strategy. LLMs are becoming sophisticated enough to serve as thought partners on this. But nobody is thinking about what happens when AI can produce 1,000 ideas and you have to select one.

This represents the real market gap. We've solved the production problem. We've made content creation trivially easy. But we haven't solved the judgment problem. We haven't built tools that help marketers decide what's worth creating in the first place.

When you can generate 1,000 advertisement variations in an hour, the bottleneck isn't creation anymore—it's curation. It's taste. It's understanding which of those 1,000 options actually serves the brand's long-term interests versus just generating short-term engagement.


## The Path Forward

We can build our way out of, and market our way out of, the local maxima we're in. We don't have to tolerate our current algorithmic experience. We can build our way out.

We don't have to tolerate a world where everyone can be deepfaked, not just celebrities like Taylor Swift. We can implement guardrails. But the key to achieving this is our willingness to think more deliberately about how we want AI to integrate into our marketing.

This is the heart of the question. If we have a local maxima, we must be more intentional with our AI usage and the way we cultivate long-term brand relationships. This is up to us as consumers to demand. It's also up to marketers, and it's up to builders who equip marketers with tools to think more intentionally.

The local maxima we're in isn't permanent. In fact, AI is accelerating us toward its breaking point. When everyone has the same AI tools, when everyone can create perfect content, when everyone can optimize for the same metrics—the optimization stops working. The local maxima collapses under its own weight.

This might be exactly what we need. We might need the system to break before we can build something better. We might need content to become so artificially perfect that we crave the imperfect. We might need relationships to become so synthetic that we value the genuine.

The brands that understand this shift—that start building for what comes after the local maxima breaks—will own the next 20 years. Not because they rejected AI, but because they understood what AI makes valuable: everything it can't do.

Physical presence. Human judgment. Real community. Genuine imperfection. The smell of a store. The texture of a product. The irreplaceable experience of being somewhere with someone, doing something that can't be downloaded, generated, or faked.

That's not going backward. That's going forward to something we haven't built yet. That's the real opportunity hiding in this crisis.

The question isn't whether this transformation will happen. It's whether your brand will be ready when it does. The local maxima is breaking. What are you building for what comes next?
