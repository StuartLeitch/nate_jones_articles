This is the AI agent guide is THE complete AI agent guide for non-techies!

It’s honestly what I teach people in like a 6 hour class, all packaged up for you so you can grab it and go at your pace.

I know you’ve probably heard me (and others) tell you that AI agents aren’t that hard, but I wanted to get more specific and useful for you.

So what I’ve put together here is the complete package, organized across four key agent tools that already exist, 28 (yes!) prompts to power those agents, and a really clear non-technical explanation of what agents are and what specifically you can do with them without any code at all.

We’re going complete here, so you don’t just get prompts, you get a very clear setup guide, current pricing on agents so you know what you’re getting into, and specific guidance on where each agent is most useful.

Here’s the full treasury:

- **What an agent is** — both a simple tech definition you can use with a developer AND a really clear non-tech definition that makes sense
- **Four ways to make agents reliable** — Grab the dials that developers use to drive agent reliability, but learn to use them without code
- **Budgeting strategy —** Yes, agents have variable cost. Here’s how I think about budgeting for them, and where they’re worth it (related to reliability for sure)
- **Your starter roster of four agents** (step-by-step setup instructions for each)

  - Manus: extraordinary for research operations (yes, better than Gemini or ChatGPT Deep Research in many cases)
  - Notion AI for reading, writing, changing your data, and making new internal resources
  - Lovable for quickly building functional apps
  - Zapier for automation—it’s a whole new game with AI tools
- **28 prompts to get the agents out of the box and WORKING** — a complete prompt treasury across research, organization, building, and automation, each following the same structure (Job, Inputs, Output, Rules, Proof) so you know exactly what to hand your agent

  - 7 Research prompts for competitive analysis, person backgrounders, vendor evaluations, and industry trends
  - 6 Organization prompts for meeting notes, brain dumps, project status, and knowledge audits
  - 6 Building prompts for personal CRMs, dashboards, landing pages, and internal tools
  - 6 Automation prompts for check-ins, notifications, digests, and cross-app syncs
  - 3 meta-prompts to help you get organized and thinking about the kinds of work you want to give your agents
- **Get started now examples** — stuck on where to start? I have specific 15-30 minutes exercises to teach you what handing work to an AI agent actually feels like
- **The 4-week progression plan** — how to go from running your first mission to having agents make decisions you didn’t explicitly program

The future is agents, and I don’t want anybody to get left behind here. I’ve put everything I can think of—all the stuff I’d put in a 6 hour class on AI agents so you can grab it here and get going. Dive in and get your agents working!


# [GRAB THE PROMPTS](https://www.notion.so/product-templates/The-Agent-Prompt-Library-25-Copy-Paste-Missions-for-Your-First-AI-Agents-2ce5a2ccb52680648243edd81fe5c3bc?source=copy_link)

This is 28 copy-paste agent prompts designed for people who've never touched an API. Each one follows the same structure—Job, Inputs, Output, Rules, Proof—because vague instructions produce hallucinated garbage while specific constraints produce work you can actually use.

The research prompts get you competitive analysis spreadsheets and vendor evaluations with source links for every claim.

The organization prompts turn meeting chaos into action items and audit your messy workspaces.

The building prompts spec out working apps—CRMs, habit trackers, landing pages—with enough detail that Lovable or Replit can build them in one shot.

The automation prompts wire up your first Zapier flows without the trial-and-error. Copy any prompt, swap in your specifics, and run your first mission tonight.

Plus there are 3 bonus meta-prompts to help you with planning, verifying, and iterating on your AI agent outputs.


## **Your AI Isn’t a Chatbot—It’s Someone You Hire**

The AI industry has a terminology problem. Everything’s an agent now. Chatbots, assistants, co-pilots, automation tools. The word has stretched so thin it means almost nothing.

So let me give you a definition that actually holds up: An agent is an AI that can do things, not just talk about them.

If you ask it a question and it answers, that’s a chatbot. If you assign it a task and it goes away, executes work, and comes back with a deliverable—a spreadsheet, a document, a working application—that’s an agent.

This distinction matters because it changes your relationship with AI. You stop having conversations and start delegating outcomes. The technical architecture behind this is simpler than the industry wants you to believe. Every agent has three components: a language model that reasons and makes decisions, tools that let it take actions in the world (browsing websites, editing files, calling APIs), and guidance that constrains what it should and shouldn’t do.

That’s it. LLM + Tools + Guidance = Agent.

The magic isn’t in any single piece—it’s in the combination. A language model without tools can only talk. Tools without a language model require you to operate them manually. Guidance without both is just a document nobody reads. Combine all three and you get something that can receive a goal, figure out how to accomplish it, execute the steps, and report back results.

I want to suggest a way of thinking about this that makes agents much easier to understand if you’re not technical. I call it the Little Guy theory, and it corresponds to how most of us intuitively think about these tools anyway.

Every agent is a Little Guy you hire to do a particular job. Your Little Guy is not a genius. Not a replacement for human judgment. Just a competent helper with particular skills and particular limitations.

This framing sets the right expectations. You wouldn’t give a new hire your company credit card on day one and say “figure it out.” You’d give them a clear assignment, limited permissions, and check their work before trusting them with more. Agents work the same way.

The Little Guy framing also clarifies what you’re optimizing for. You’re not trying to build artificial general intelligence in your Notion workspace. You’re trying to get tasks done without doing them yourself. That means reliability beats capability every single time.

I would rather have an agent that correctly researches 20 companies than one that attempts 100 and hallucinates half the data. I’d rather have an automation that handles 80% of cases perfectly than one that tries to handle everything and fails unpredictably—forcing me to manually check every single output.

The goal is not to be impressed by what agents can do. The goal is to trust what they deliver so you can actually delegate.


## **Four Knobs That Control Everything**

Before you hire your first Little Guy, understand the four variables you can adjust. Getting these right is the difference between useful automation and chaotic nonsense.

The first knob is **habitat**—where does the agent live? Some agents operate on the open web, browsing websites and extracting information. Others live inside your workspace, organizing and transforming content you already have. Others build software. Others connect applications and move data between them.

Pick one habitat to start. Mixing them is possible, but it creates complexity you don’t need when you’re learning the fundamentals.

The second knob is **hands**—what can the agent touch? Read-only access is safest: the agent has eyes but can’t change anything. Click permissions let it take actions like submitting forms or updating records—more powerful, but riskier. Spend permissions give it access to payment methods or irreversible changes. Keep that off until you deeply trust the system.

The third knob is **leash**—how much freedom does it get? A tightly leashed agent follows explicit step-by-step instructions every time. A loosely leashed agent gets goals and figures out its own approach. If you’re just getting started, keep the leash tight. Define instructions as carefully as you can to avoid confusion and unhappy outcomes.

The fourth knob is **proof**—can the agent show it did the job correctly? This means specifying what success looks like and requiring evidence: source links, screenshots, logs, before-and-after comparisons. If an agent can’t show you its work, you can’t verify its work. And if you can’t verify it, you can’t trust it.

One note on pricing that reinforces this mental model: most agent tools charge by usage (credits, tasks, or activities)—basically paying by the work done. You’re hiring the agent for a job, just like you’d hire a person. This should keep reliability at the forefront of your mind—if you’re paying someone to do work, you expect them to be reliable.


## **Your Roster: Four Little Guys That Cover 90% of Tasks**

Forget the enterprise platforms and developer tools. These four agents handle huge chunks of what a non-technical person needs to accomplish.

**Manus** is your internet researcher. It lives in the cloud, spins up a browser you can watch in real time, navigates websites the way a human would, and compiles findings into structured deliverables like spreadsheets or documents. The experience is almost eerie the first time—you assign a task like “compare pricing and features for these 10 competitors,” and you literally watch it open tabs, scroll through pages, copy data into a table, and deliver a CSV 20 minutes later. What would have taken you three hours of clicking and copying happens while you do other things.

> **Pro Note:** Manus is not JUST an internet researcher. It can build powerpoints (including nice inline edits) and websites and more. But the most powerful and reliable applications I’ve seen have come from the research space.

The free tier gives you 300 credits daily, enough to test it. Paid plans start at $20 a month and scale up (with options shown up to $200/month for heavy users). The key to using Manus well is specificity: tell it exactly what columns you want, what sources are acceptable, what format you need. Vague instructions produce vague results.

**Notion AI** is your chief of staff. It lives inside your Notion workspace and can use everything you have access to in your workspace. You ask questions in natural language, and it responds with answers drawn from your content. The Notion 3.0 update introduced AI Agents that don’t just suggest but execute: you can assign multi-step tasks like “compile all Q4 feedback and create a summary database.” These agents can also use connected apps and web research within the permissions you grant—so it’s primarily your workspace, but not limited to it.

> **Pro Note:** Notion AI implementations can get extremely sophisticated. The jobs I’m suggesting are just scratching the surface. I know entrepreneurs who run their entire back office using Notion AI automations. Start small and just get something working, but you can be confident there’s a high ceiling here.

Free and Plus plans include a limited AI trial; Business and Enterprise plans get full Agent capabilities. The key to using it well is recognizing it works best with what you’ve already captured—sparse notes mean sparse outputs. If you’re on the trial, you may hit limits quickly on complex tasks.

**Lovable** is your app builder. You describe what you want in plain English, and it generates a complete working application with a live URL you can share. Say “build me a personal CRM with fields for name, company, last contact date, and notes” and watch it create a React frontend connected to a database. You iterate through conversation: “make the header blue,” “add a search bar,” “connect it to Stripe.”

> **Pro Note:** One reason to love Lovable is how fast they ship. They have relentlessly added feature after feature to make it easier for non-technical builders to build, like payments support, built-in backend support, improved bug fixing, automated security scanning, etc.

What makes Lovable different is you get real, exportable code—not locked-in no-code blocks. You can push to GitHub or continue in VS Code. The free tier gives you 5 credits per day, up to 30 per month. “Ask AI to fix” messages don’t count against your credits. The key is starting with a clear mental picture and describing it precisely. The AI can’t read your mind, but it’s excellent at interpreting detailed instructions. Note: if your initial build plus iterations exceed 5 credits, you may need to wait for credits to refresh before continuing.

**Zapier** is your logistics manager. It connects applications and automates workflows: when something happens in App A, do something in App B. The platform has added AI Agents that bring reasoning to traditional automations—instead of rigid if-then rules, agents can analyze incoming data and choose appropriate actions dynamically.

Important pricing note: Zapier has two separate pricing structures. The core automation platform (Zaps) starts free with 100 tasks/month (Free plan is best for simple Zaps), with paid plans from $19.99/month. Zapier Agents are priced separately by activities: Free gets you 400 activities/month, Pro is $50/month for 1,500 activities. Start with basic Zaps until you understand how they work. There’s no point adding AI reasoning to a system that operates better with simple rules. The key is starting with one trigger and one action, getting that working, then adding complexity when you actually need it.


## **Get Started: Onboarding + Pricing for Each Agent**

Yes, I’m listing pricing details twice in this article on purpose. People always ask!


### **[1) Manus (Web Research Agent)](https://manus.im/app)**

**Pricing (USD)**

- Free: $0/month with 300 daily refresh credits, 1 concurrent task, 2 scheduled tasks.
- Pro: starts at $20/month (annual discount mentioned) and includes monthly credits starting at 4,000.
- Team: starts at $40 per seat/month (annual discount mentioned).
- Credits are Manus’s usage unit; they’re consumed based on things like LLM tokens, cloud VMs, and third-party APIs.

**Step-by-step onboarding**

1. Create an account and start a new task in Agent Mode (Agent Mode is the “do work” mode vs pure chat).
2. For web tasks, use the default Cloud Browser; if you hit login/CAPTCHA the product will prompt you to take over and complete the verification manually.
3. Optional (recommended if you want Google outputs): open Connectors in your Manus workspace → choose Google Drive → authorize.
4. Optional (for “logged-in” sites like premium research tools): install Manus Browser Operator, then toggle the “My Browser” connector; Manus can operate in your local browser with your existing sessions.

### **[2) Notion AI / Notion Agents (Workspace Agent)](https://www.notion.so/)**

**Pricing (USD)**

- Free: $0 per member/month and includes a trial of Notion AI capabilities.
- Plus: $10 per member/month and includes a trial of Notion AI capabilities.
- Business: $20 per member/month and includes Agent (”completes complex, multi-step tasks using context from Notion, connected apps, and the web”).
- Enterprise: custom pricing.

**Step-by-step onboarding**

1. Confirm your plan: if you want full Agent + connectors at scale, you’re generally looking at Business/Enterprise; Free/Plus are explicitly framed as Limited Trial for AI capabilities.
2. In Notion, go to Settings → Notion AI to manage AI settings and connectors.
3. If you’re adding connectors (Slack/Drive/GitHub/etc.): you must be the workspace owner and have admin rights in the connected app; ingestion can take up to 72 hours depending on content volume.
4. If connecting Google Drive specifically: you must be a Google Drive admin and Notion workspace owner, and it’s Business/Enterprise only; setup is Settings → Notion AI → + next to Google Drive.
5. If connecting GitHub: setup is Settings → Notion AI → + next to GitHub (and owner requirements differ for org vs private repos).
6. If you want web-backed research reports: use Research Mode, which can search your workspace, connected apps, and the web (and you can toggle web search off).

### **[3) Lovable (App Builder)](https://lovable.dev/)**

**Pricing (USD)**

- Free: 5 daily credits, max 30 per month.
- Pro (starts): $25/month (shared across unlimited users) and includes 100 credits/month (plus daily credits up to 150/month).
- Business (starts): $50/month (shared across unlimited users) and includes 100 credits/month.
- Lovable also offers higher credit tiers (e.g., 200/400/800… credits/month) with published prices in its docs.

**Step-by-step onboarding**

1. Sign up at Lovable, then create your first project by typing a prompt into the dashboard (”describe what you want to build”).
2. Build in small increments (one feature at a time) to control cost and complexity.
3. When you’re ready to share, Publish the app. Note: on Free and Pro, published apps are public and accessible to anyone with the link (no access restrictions).
4. Optional (recommended): connect the project to GitHub to back up and sync code both ways.
5. Optional (if you want a real backend): use the native Supabase integration for database/auth/storage/edge functions.

### **[4) Zapier (Automation + Optional Zapier Agents)](https://zapier.com/l/home?utm_ads_campaign_id=17565686835&utm_ads_adset_id=139732742362&utm_ads_ad_id=747627668604&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17565686835)**

**Pricing (Zapier platform: tasks/month, USD)**

- Free: $0/month, includes 100 tasks/month and two-step Zaps.
- Professional: starting from $19.99/month billed annually.
- Team: starting from $69/month billed annually.

**Pricing (Zapier Agents: activities/month, USD — separate)**

- Free: $0, includes 400 activities/month and up to 10 activities per agent run.
- Pro: $50/month, includes 1,500 activities/month and up to 40 activities per agent run.

**Step-by-step onboarding**

1. Create a Zapier account and connect the two apps you want to automate first (e.g., Gmail + Notion, or Slack + Google Sheets).
2. Build one simple Zap end-to-end: one trigger → one action (a two-step Zap fits Free).
3. Turn it on, run a real test, and confirm tasks are counting the way you expect (tasks count when an action successfully runs).
4. Only after your basic Zaps are reliable: experiment with Zapier Agents for workflows that need reasoning + web browsing + live data sources.

## **Get Started With These 4 Agent Missions**

Theory is easy to talk about. Let me give you specific exercises you can actually do with each agent. Each takes 15-30 minutes and teaches you something essential about delegation.


### **Mission 1: The Researcher (Manus)**

Create an account at manus.im and pick Agent Mode for “do work” tasks. Then paste this prompt:

> Compare the top 5 email marketing tools for small creators in 2025. Output a CSV with columns:

- Tool name
- Starting price
- Free plan limits
- Best for (one sentence)
- One gotcha or limitation
- Source URL for pricing page

> Visit the official pricing page for each tool. Do not guess prices.

Watch it work through the Cloud Browser—it opens automatically when the task needs web access. Use the Take Over feature only if it hits a CAPTCHA or needs SMS verification. When it delivers the spreadsheet, open three source links and verify the prices match what’s on the page. You’re learning that agents can do research at scale, but you must verify outputs. The source link requirement keeps them honest.

Optional: connect Google Drive in the Connectors settings so outputs can land directly as Docs or Sheets instead of downloaded files.


### **Mission 2: The Organizer (Notion AI)**

First, confirm you’re on a plan that includes what you need—Free/Plus trial for basic AI, Business/Enterprise for full Agent capabilities. Go to Settings → Notion AI to enable AI and manage any connectors (Slack, Google Drive, GitHub). If using connectors, expect initial sync to take some time.

Find the messiest page in your Notion workspace—a brain dump, copied text, chaotic meeting notes. Ask Notion AI:

> Read this page. Extract every action item into a checkbox list. Group by person responsible. If no deadline is specified, mark as “TBD.” If no owner is clear, mark as “Unassigned.”

Review the output against your original content. Does it match what was actually discussed, or did it invent plausible-sounding tasks? You’re learning that workspace agents transform what you already have—they’re best for organization, though they can also pull from connected apps and web when needed.


### **Mission 3: The Builder (Lovable)**

Go to Lovable and paste this:

> Build me a Personal CRM app. It needs:

- A form to add a person (Name, Company, Last Met Date, Notes)
- Display people in a card grid
- A search bar at the top to filter by company
- Modern, clean design
- No authentication needed

Watch it build. Click through the preview. Hit Publish and open the URL on your phone. Note: Free and Pro published apps are public with no access restrictions. You’re learning that the barrier to creating custom tools is now “can you describe what you want?” If you want a real backend, Lovable has native Supabase integration. You can also export to GitHub anytime.


### **Mission 4: The Automation (Zapier)**

Create a new Zap with these settings:

- **Trigger:** Schedule by Zapier → Every day at 9am
- **Action:** Send yourself a Slack DM (or email) that says: “Daily check: What’s the one thing you must complete today?”

Note: new signups get a 14-day trial of premium features; some may disappear if you downgrade to Free. Test the Zap immediately, then let it run for three days. Check whether it fires at 9am in your timezone or 9am UTC—timezone misconfiguration is the most common failure. You’re learning that the most reliable workflows are deterministic: when X happens, do Y. Add AI reasoning (via Zapier Agents, priced separately) only after you understand how the basics work.


## **The Progression: How to Level Up**

Don’t try to do everything at once. Here’s the path I recommend.

**Week 1** is about becoming an operator. Pick one agent—Manus or Notion AI—and run 3-5 missions in that single tool. Focus on writing clear instructions, verifying outputs, and iterating when results aren’t right. Success looks like saving 3+ hours of work you would have done manually.

**Week 2** is about building something. Spend time in Lovable creating a dashboard for something you care about, a tool your team needs, or an MVP for an idea you’ve been sitting on. Success looks like having a working tool at a live URL that you actually use.

**Week 3** is about connecting the pieces. Use Zapier to make your tools talk to each other: research in Manus flows into Notion, form submissions in Lovable trigger Slack notifications. Success looks like having at least one automation running that you don’t think about.

**Week 4** is when you loosen the leash. Now—and only now—experiment with Zapier Agents making decisions based on context, Notion AI executing multi-step workflows, or chains where one agent triggers another. Success looks like an agent making a decision you didn’t explicitly program, and it being the right decision.


## **The Rules to Tape Next to Your Monitor**

These keep you from learning the expensive lessons:

- **If unsure, ask.** Tell every agent: “If you’re stuck or uncertain, ask one clarifying question. Do not guess.”
- **No wallets.** Never give an agent direct access to payment methods or bank logins.
- **The 10% rule.** Agents do 90% of the work. You do the last 10%: review, edit, verify, approve.
- **One job at a time.** Don’t say “research this, then email them, then build the app.” That’s three missions. Break them up.
- **Source or it didn’t happen.** Any claim without a link is a hallucination until proven otherwise.
- **Start tight, loosen later.** Begin with explicit step-by-step instructions. Only give more freedom after you’ve seen how the agent handles edge cases.


## **The Meta-Skill Underneath All of This**

Everything in this guide depends on one ability: writing clear instructions. Here’s the template I use for every agent mission:

- **Job:** What outcome do I want? Be specific.
- **Inputs:** What sources can it use? What can’t it touch?
- **Output:** Exact format—columns, sections, file type.
- **Rules:** What it must do. What it must not do.
- **Proof:** How it shows me it did the job right.

**Bad instruction:** “Research competitors.”

**Good instruction:** “Research the top 5 competitors to [Company] in [Industry]. For each, provide company name, founding year, estimated revenue range, key differentiator in one sentence, and source URL. Output as CSV. Do not include companies outside [Geography]. If you can’t find revenue data, write ‘Not disclosed’ with a note explaining what you searched.”

The more specific your instruction, the less the agent guesses—and the fewer opportunities for hallucination.


## **What Agents Still Can’t Do Well**

Be honest about the limits. Nuanced judgment calls that require understanding your specific context, culture, or relationships—you make those. Irreversible actions like send, delete, pay, or publish need human approval in the loop. Creative vision: agents can draft and iterate, but the vision of what you’re building is yours. Learning from one example: agents don’t have memory across sessions, so consistent behavior requires consistent instructions. And admitting confusion—agents often guess instead of asking for clarification, which is why you build “ask if unsure” into every instruction.


## **Your Move**

Tonight, run Mission 1. Just the one.

Get a spreadsheet back that you didn’t have to build yourself. Verify three facts in it. Feel what it’s like to delegate to an AI and have it actually work.

The people who thrive with agents don’t have technical backgrounds. They can articulate what “done” looks like clearly enough that someone else—or something else—can deliver it.

The future isn’t learning to code. It’s learning to delegate. And that starts with your first Little Guy.

What agent are you going to try first? Reply and tell me—I read every response.
